Webmetic serves clients like Messe München, Condor, and freelance.de with a transparent pay-per-lead pricing model ranging from €0.40-€0.95 per identified company.",Munich,"B2B Analytics, Visitor Identification, Website Personalization, Privacy Compliance",Between €1-€100K,2025,https://webmetic.de/,Active,https://www.linkedin.com/company/webmetic/?originalSubdomain=de,DE,"# Webmetic Business Description
## Webmetic: Transforming B2B Marketing in the Post-Cookie Era
**Webmetic** is a Munich-based technology company that has solved the biggest challenge facing B2B marketing today: identifying and personalizing for anonymous website visitors without compromising privacy. As traditional tracking methods crumble under browser restrictions and GDPR enforcement, Webmetic provides the privacy-first alternative that actually works better.
### The Problem We Solve
**95% of B2B website visitors remain anonymous.** Companies like BMW, Siemens, and Mercedes-Benz visit your website, research your products, and leave without a trace. Sales teams miss massive opportunities because they don't know who showed interest. Marketing budgets get wasted on broad campaigns when specific companies are already engaged.
Traditional solutions are broken. Cookie-based tracking is blocked by modern browsers. Privacy regulations make fingerprinting illegal. Consent banners kill conversion rates. The old playbook doesn't work in 2025.
### Our Revolutionary Solution
Webmetic identifies **which companies** visit your website in real-time, then automatically personalizes their experience – all without cookies, consent banners, or privacy violations.
**Real-Time Company Intelligence**: Instantly discover when BMW visits your automation solutions page or when Volkswagen downloads your manufacturing whitepaper. Get company name, industry, size, location, and engagement insights the moment they arrive.
**Smart Website Personalization**: Your website automatically adapts content for each visiting company. Automotive manufacturers see industry-specific case studies. Healthcare companies see compliance-focused messaging. Every visitor encounters content that speaks directly to their business needs.
**100% Privacy Compliant**: Operates under GDPR without consent requirements. All processing happens in German data centers. External legal validation confirms complete compliance. No cookies, no tracking, no privacy violations.
### Proven Results That Matter
**30-80% conversion rate improvements** through personalized experiences. **50% better lead quality** because prospects already understand your relevance. **Reduced acquisition costs** through precise targeting. **Enhanced sales efficiency** with qualified prospect intelligence before they even inquire.
Current clients include **Messe München**, **Condor**, **freelance.de**, and major European trade shows like ISPO and IAA Mobility. The platform identifies over **47,000 active companies monthly** across customer websites.
### Why Webmetic Wins
**Technology Leadership**: Only provider with completely cookie-free architecture immune to browser changes and privacy regulations.
**Superior Data Quality**: Advanced AI algorithms deliver higher accuracy than cookie-based competitors, with comprehensive company profiles including industry classifications and digital presence data.
**Effortless Implementation**: Works with any website technology. Integration takes days, not months. No technical expertise required.
**Transparent Pricing**: Pay only for identified companies (€0.40-€0.95 each). No setup fees, no data limits, no hidden costs. ROI is immediate and measurable.
### Market Opportunity
The **€3.2 billion global B2B visitor identification market** is in complete upheaval. Chrome eliminates cookies in 2025. GDPR enforcement intensifies. Traditional providers are scrambling to adapt broken technologies while Webmetic leads with purpose-built solutions.
Companies that move first gain decisive advantages. While competitors struggle with consent rates and tracking failures, early adopters deliver personalized experiences that convert at dramatically higher rates.
### The Webmetic Advantage
Founded by **Yannik Süß**, a technology entrepreneur with 15+ years in web analytics and a track record of successful implementations at major companies like E.ON, ING, and Condor. The team combines deep technical expertise with proven business experience across B2B marketing, enterprise sales, and regulatory compliance.
**This isn't incremental improvement – it's the future of B2B marketing.** Webmetic enables the transition from privacy-invasive tracking to sophisticated, compliant intelligence that delivers superior results while respecting user privacy.
The post-cookie web is here. The question isn't whether to adapt – it's whether you'll lead the transition or follow behind. Webmetic provides the technology to lead.
**Transform anonymous traffic into qualified opportunities. Personalize without privacy violations. Convert visitors who would otherwise disappear forever.**

Energy production is shifting towards an increased share of renewable energy sources. The challenge is that solar panels and wind turbines do not constantly produce the same amount of energy. Much renewable energy is produced when the sun is shining, and the wind is blowing, but only a bit when there is no sun shining and no wind blowing. This leads to an increasing mismatch of supply and demand in the energy market. Our AI-based solutions will help alleviate this mismatch and make energy affordable for millions of households.

This approach significantly optimizes time and financial expenses for our clients. Additionally, we offer a unique solution for managing excess inventory, allowing companies to post and sell surplus stock, freeing up resources for further development. 

Operating globally, with a strong European presence and expanding to the US, we provide unmatched access and convenience in the electronic components market. Our commitment to transparency, security, and customer satisfaction sets us apart, making ChipCart an essential partner in the electronics sector.",Pforzheim,"#ChipCart, #ElectronicsMarketplace, #FutureVision, #ExcessStockSolution",No funding announced yet,2023,https://chipcart.com/,Active,https://de.linkedin.com/company/chipcart,DE,"ChipCart is a young startup in the field of electronic component sales, launched in September 2023.
Our startup is the result of a merger between an IT development team and experienced professionals in the electronic components market.
The project was developed by an international team with extensive experience in developing ERP systems for trade and warehouse business. These are high-class professionals with experience in launching E-commerce projects worldwide. Currently, our team includes 35 developers.
The most challenging part of working in the electronic components market is correctly combining modern technologies with the traditions and experience of classic distribution. Only professionals with vast experience in this market can handle such a task. They have become the connecting link that created ChipCart, led by our CEO, who has over 35 years of experience in the electronic components sales industry.
Uniting modern technical solutions with extensive market experience was achieved by professionals experienced in working with electronic components, led by our CEO with over 30 years of experience in the industry.
Advantages of Our Project
Wide Supplier Base
Typically, each manufacturer works with 5-6 component suppliers. This limitation is due to significant time and financial burdens. The more suppliers there are, the more time is needed to obtain data - prices, availability, delivery terms, special conditions, etc.
Our platform consolidates data from more than 250 suppliers, including official distributors, catalogs, and partners, including connected partner warehouses, OEM, and EMS.
We operate transparently and convey the sources of components. Thus, every buyer can visit the original site and ensure that the displayed price of components matches the source's price.
For our clients, this optimizes time and financial expenses on purchases, plus budget savings due to choosing the optimal price.
In layman's terms, we are a platform that in real-time displays offers from the largest marketplaces and online stores, allowing you to choose the best conditions in terms of price and delivery time, and receive all orders in one delivery, instead of 5-10 different deliveries. All this at the same price as if you were buying directly from each separate site.
Convenience
This approach allows all work to be done in one window. Even if you purchase 50 different components from 15 suppliers, you only sign one contract with us and receive everything in one free delivery.
Our platform is absolutely free. We do not set markups or hidden commissions. You can buy from your usual suppliers on the terms you are accustomed to.
Additionally, you receive online analytics of the purchase price from all suppliers, including your ""neighbors"" who have excess electronic components.
Working with Excess Inventory
One of our key advantages is working with excess inventory. Currently, many companies are concerned about the situation with excess inventory of electronic components in their warehouses. This is frozen money and occupied space.
Our platform works not only with catalogs but also allows any company, after data verification, to post and sell their excess inventory. This enables businesses to free up financial flows and warehouse space and redirect these resources to development.
Our platform provides access to the global market and operates 24/7. Starting work is very simple – just send a list of items and provide data on the originality of components. After agreeing on all details, the goods appear on the platform.
For the convenience and safety of our clients, we thoroughly check the source of components and datacode to ensure the originality of goods. We also have high requirements for updating data through API, giving us an up-to-date picture of component availability in the warehouse.
Confidentiality and security are very important to us. We do not disclose companies that sell their goods through the excess inventory program.
Unlike traditional brokers, we use all the possibilities of modern IT for automation and simplification of processes. The client sees the price and quantity in real-time. There is no need to send a request. Just click the ""buy"" button, and all components (even from different sources) will arrive in one free delivery.
We believe that our platform will help the market achieve balance and relieve European manufacturers from the burden of excess inventory.
Geography as an Advantage
We are a European company that takes advantage of global work with all markets. Currently, our office is located in Germany. We also have representations in Hong Kong, Singapore, and plan to open an office in the USA mid-year.
At the moment, the European market knows little about Chinese distributors of electronic components. On our platform, you can see warehouses and prices for components on these platforms.
This gives the customer an incredible level of freedom in choosing a source for purchasing electronic components."

aimed analytics,https://www.eu-startups.com/directory/aimed-analytics/,Germany,"Business concept in one sentence:  
We accelerate, deepen, and democratize the knowledge gain from biomedical data for our customers from pharma and biotech. 

Product and customer benefit:
We develop a platform that provides access to cutting-edge analysis of all kinds of biomedical data in an easy way.  

It is obvious that the success of newly starting pharma and biotech companies is highly dependent on the usage of modern ways to analyze big biomedical data. However, due to high competition with other business areas for machine learning and data analysis specialists, talent is highly restricted. Companies lacking talent in this area miss on the promises of modern data analysis to cut down research costs and time-to-market resulting in a competitive disadvantage.  

Our software-as-a-service platform allows the pharma and biotech companies to analyze biomedical data without access to trained personnel. In addition, the platform offers a high coverage of machine learning and technology specific analysis modules than can be combined to provide in-depth insights into efficacy, mechanism-of-action, toxicity and other parameters that are important to the success of drug candidates. Those crucial insights can be used to improve the drug development processes.  

Our platform will democratize the usage of cutting-edge data analysis for pharma and biotech companies, which will greatly benefit the discovery of novel treatments of human diseases.",Bonn,"biomedicine, big data, analysis, saas",No funding announced yet,2023,www.aimed-analytics.com,,,DE,"Our USP:
The main unique selling point of aimed analytics is the platform and the architecture itself. The platform rethinks how biomedical data is analyzed. The modular system enables that medical data can be analyzed quickly and highly flexibly in order to answer a wide range of medical questions. This is crucial to cover the wide range of data analysis demands of our target customers. Furthermore, the underlying architecture allows the platform to grow with the progress and developments in the field of biomedical data analysis and hence to become more and more powerful.  
The principle of the platform also enables that any input data can be used, as the system is easily adaptable to different data types (e.g. genomics data, imaging data or patient's medical records). Thus, aimed analytics brings a solution to the market that enables every owner of medical data to quickly gain deep biological/clinical/medical insights into their data. Our platform is designed in such a way that the customer can easily and intuitively request an analysis and eventually interact with the generated results in a highly interactive way. With the aimed analytics platform, we have created a universal solution for medical data analysis which is a critical building block for today's era of modern data-based medicine.
Our initial customers are small and medium pharma and biotech companies (2026, from 4.9 billion to 45.2 billion USD (global prognosis, Source: Statista)). Initially, we will focus on the niche of small and medium biotech and pharma companies. This creates a directly serviceable obtainable market of 450 million USD (Europe, North America and Japan).       
No competitor currently offers an equivalent solution. Competitors either rely on pure services with limited scaling potential, on pure software solutions which do not provide the high flexibility of our system or they have focused on very specific medical issues. 
One of our strategies for a market entry relies on our extensive network in international biomedical research institutes.
Achievements:
With the concept, that aimed analytics advanced into the above mentioned platform, Dr. Günther and Dr. Baßler were already able to convince experts and received the renowned EXIST-Gründerstipendium from the Federal Ministry of Economics and Climate Protection. 
Furthermore, the idea has already been awarded and honored in numerous competitions, such as a University Bonn idea competition and the WOWFAKTOR ideas competition of the DIGITALHUB Bonn. 
With regard to the status of the platform, the proof-of-concept was successfully completed. Currently, we have started the test phase of our alpha-version of the platform with pilot customers. Recruiting pilot customers has proven to be extremely easy, as there is already a high demand for our solution due to the strong need in the market. In the process, we have not yet launched any active marketing, but the demand solely generated through word-to-mouth. To take the platform to the next level of development, we are currently recruiting a developer to join our team."

NFT are on everyone's lips. The abbreviation stands for Non fungible Token (not exchangeable or unique assets). Behind them are mostly digital collectibles, images or access rights - for example for discord servers. On the platform nft.scoopas.com, artists can now create their own NFTs and sell them to their fans. The team at Scoopas offers a unique service for this and provides full support in the planning, creation and launch of NFT projects. ""We want to support artists to realize their ideas and projects. Even if, and especially if, they have no experience with NFT, crypto or blockchain"" tells Steven Palumbo (COO at Scoopas).
Scoopas is particularly interesting because it focuses exclusively on the music and artist industry as a provider of NFTs. In addition, artists are individually supported by the Scoopas team in the creation and marketing of NFTs. Purchases of NFTs are also very easy for fans. These can also be processed easily in euros.
Interested parties can register or apply for the Scoopas NFT platform by providing a few key data. After successful registration, the Scoopas team will contact you to discuss the possibilities and initial ideas so that the artists* can create their own NFTs and sell them to their fans."" We are already in talks with well-known artists who are enthusiastically working on presenting their first NFTs on the platform,"" Steven Palumbo reports.
NFTs offer real added value to their buyers, as they are limited and can grant special privileges. Examples for NFT can be special songs, videos, unique pictures or digital tickets. If you want to learn more about the topic and are interested in your own NFT as a new source of income, you can apply now at nft.scoopas.com in just 2 minutes. Free of charge and without obligation!
A unique microcosm for musicians* and their fans
In the future, musicians will be able to build up the second income stream via Scoopas by streaming live concerts. They generate money by selling digital concert tickets for streams on the Scoopas platform, offering merchandise items or having their fans support them with a donation. This component of the Scoopas microcosm is scheduled to go live later in 2022.
""Our team is currently working on the extensive programming of our platform. We have already successfully implemented the first streams and will be adding one or two other live concerts to our stream in the coming months. On the one hand, this way we make sure that the technology works properly as it should and at the same time we get valuable information and requests fed back to us first-hand.""
Scoopas' musician platform is a revolution for the music industry because it is a microcosm that directly connects musicians and their fans. Record companies or labels are no longer necessarily needed as financial backers, or marketing entities for musicians*. Scoopas offers a powerful tool to generate more income, build reputation and put self-determination back into the hands of the artists.

mellow,https://www.eu-startups.com/directory/mellow/,Cyprus,"Mellow is an HR platform offering tools and solutions that transform the way companies engage with contingent workers. It enables the seamless integration of contractors into companies' workflows, streamlining their talent management and selection processes. Additionally, Mellow provides various mechanisms to support freelancers with a wide array of issues, including payment solutions. With offices in New York, Limassol, and London, Mellow's services are available globally.",Limassol,"HR, Contractors, Solution",No funding announced yet,2024,https://www.mellow.io/contacts,Active,,CY,"Mellow is a global HR platform transforming how companies engage with contractors, moving from one-time task hires to incorporating them as integral members of the workforce. The company streamlines this process through a set of technological solutions and by assuming all risks and obligations associated with engaging contractors, such as misclassification or legal issues. At the same time, it benefits contractors by ensuring they are paid and receive benefits, bridging the gap between full-time and project-based work.
Mellow was founded in 2024 by Pavel Shynkarenko, an entrepreneur with over 20 years of experience in financial and legal technologies and client-contractor relationship automation. In 2014, he noticed a growing demand for payment and administrative assistance for businesses working with independent contractors, and this prompted him to launch his first HR tech company, Solar Staff. Initially, the firm provided solutions for service deal optimization. This gradually led to the creation of a multi-tool platform that capitalizes on Solar Staff's decade-long work in this field and responds to the growing demand for specialized solutions for long-term interaction with contractors. Thus, Solar Staff, as a global company, pivoted to Mellow, transferring to it an extensive base of clients in the USA and Europe. Mellow’s mission is to help companies prepare for the future of work, where contract relationships become a common alternative to full-time employment. The company’s CEO is Pavel Shynkarenko, who has stepped down from leading Solar Staff to fully concentrate on this new venture. Benefiting from Solar Staff's client base, Mellow is already working with more than 1,500 companies and 400,000 contractors from over 100 countries. It has a monthly turnover of €18M and an MRR of €800K.
Despite playing in a crowded field, Mellow stands out from its competitors. For instance, firms like Deel, Remote, and Oyster limit themselves to offering either Employer-of-Record (EOR) services for company staff members or tools like payroll management, but do not assume any legal risks. Other services, like Deel Shield, Worksome, and Talent Desk, focus exclusively on expensive Contractor-of-Record (COR) services. On the other hand, Mellow comes with a set of various contractor-related solutions within one contract, and a pay-as-you-go model that makes the non-employee engagement process convenient, transparent, and legally viable. This is the case even when companies are working with contractors from hard-to-reach regions.
The portfolio of Mellow’s solutions is centered on regional demand. The US-based tools, which feature Contractor-of-Record service and an AI-powered tool for finding the right talent by leveraging the hiring manager’s network, are focused on B2B audiences. The European solutions respond to the local demand for enhancing freelancers’ social security, including payment-related assistance, legal services for obtaining digital nomad visas, and tax support.
Mellow is headquartered in Limassol (Cyprus) and has offices in New York and London. The company has a team of 60 people and works with brands such as SumSub, Joom, G2G, Paltalk, Clickadu and Stocksy."

TrÃ¶delSpende,https://www.eu-startups.com/directory/trodelspende/,Germany,"TrödelSpende is an online second hand marketplace where people can exchange their items for a donation to an NGO. It works just like every other online second hand marketplace, with the exception that the item price is fully donated. Users can therefore declutter their home and help their favorite non-profit organization to raise funds. This will promote a circular economy with less waste and more resource efficiency. At the same time people can have an impact while shopping online by supporting charity. Givers of their items will receive a tax receipt so they can deduct the donation item price from their taxes.",Berlin,"social, circular, charity, donation",No funding announced yet,2021,www.troedelspende.de,,,DE,"Non-profit organizations often have difficulties collecting donations and can therefore only advance their projects in a limited way. In consequence the impact they have is not as wide as it could be. On the other hand, people are willing to make more and bigger donations than ever and want to have a broader impact with the choices they make. Yet, they still have to support non-profit organizations by the established way of sending them their money.
At the same time, a completely different problem is that many people have numerous items at home that they no longer need or that they could do without. Many people want to live a more sustainable life and are therefore selling and buying items second-hand. In consequence the online market for second-hand is booming right now.
TrödelSpende solves these two problems by creating a second-hand online marketplace where individual items can be exchanged for a donation to a non-profit organization: The donor advertises their item and someone else receives that item only in exchange for a donation to a non-profit organization chosen by the donor. In the end, everyone profits from this: The item donors can raise money for their favorite local charities while recycling their unused items. In return they can deduct the raised amount from their annual tax. For the item buyers, they not only ecologically consume by using a second hand marketplace, they also make a sustainable and ethical action by giving their money to the people and organizations that need it the most. For non-profit organizations, it is a new easy and passive way to raise some funds."

Counsel provided by EQWAL are not external counsel. They are part of the inhouse team, for a limited time. They think and act like experienced inhouse counsel, because they are. Depending on individual needs, they bring either specific knowledge or skills to the existing team, or they simply expand the team’s capacity.",Berlin,"Alternative Legal Service Provider, Flexible Legal, Legal Interim",No funding announced yet,2021,https://www.eqwal.legal/about-eqwal-en/,,,DE,"Typically, inhouse workload fluctuates depending on certain projects and regulatory requirements. Sometimes, positions become vacant or cannot be filled as quickly as needed. Staffing an inhouse team to cover any fluctuations is cost prohibitive. As a result, teams are staffed slimly. And work that cannot be covered internally during “peak situations” is given to external law firms. On a regular basis, this concept also applies to work that doesn’t require specialist expertise or the liability coverage of a law firm. The work is outsourced simply because there is no internal capacity.
Law firms, however, are very expensive for several reasons. Due to their time-based billing models, little incentive exists to think pragmatically and act as inhouse counsel. In addition, communication between the legal department and the law firm tends to be inefficient. After all, law firms are external service providers with very different revenue mechanics and without first-hand experience working inside a corporate legal department.
With EQWAL, legal departments can easily scale up and down, depending on their current workload. They no longer need to instruct external law firms with work they would preferably handle internally to external law firms. As a result, legal departments benefit economically while remaining in full control of the quality of their work."

clare&me,https://www.eu-startups.com/directory/clareme-2/,Germany,"On a mission to break the taboo around the topic of mental health and democratise access to support, clare&me was founded in 2021 in Berlin by Emilia Theye and Celina Messner, who have since been joined by Xaver Ebner as a technical co-founder. 

Mental health is finally getting more recognition amongst society. More often, people are recognising the importance of caring for their mental health as much as their physical health. However, access to support remains a challenge. 

Anxiety disorders and depression are among the most common mental illnesses, and it’s claimed by the healthtech startup that around 374 million people worldwide are affected by anxiety disorders, and around 246 million suffer from depression. What’s more, the pandemic has exacerbated the problem – increasing the total number of people affected by mental health challenges by 25% since 2020.

Speech therapy has been shown to have a positive effect in treating both anxiety and depression, but it’s no secret that the demand far exceeds the supply. Access to therapy that is affordable and of a high standard is severely lacking. Clare&me was developed to help the millions of people who do not have access to such help or are reluctant to seek it – an artificial intelligence that engages in verbal conversations with users via smartphone and conveys clinically proven approaches to behavioural therapy.

Clare&me is designed to feel human and is intended to counteract the significant bottlenecks in treatment capacity – offering psychological support for everyone, regardless of location and time.",Berlin,"AI-driven, audio, bot",Between €500K-€ 1 million,2021,https://www.clareandme.com/,,,DE,

Solutions are based on big data as well as artificial intelligence
analytics. The first product - a mobile app to enable robust route planning and safe travel on unpaved roads - will be launched in 2020. The long-term product portfolio will consist of applications and services to improve driving safety on difficult roads worldwide under all weather conditions with respect to the
specific vehicle capabilities. These services will be provided as mobile apps and integrated into the on-board units of vehicles.
Bareways’ innovation is to aggregate and analyze real-time data by means of artificial intelligence from vehicle sensors and earth observation satellites to predict if a specific road can be traveled at a specific time by a specific vehicle. Today, such datasets are to a large extent publicly available via open data portals from public authorities and government agencies. However, they lack a consistent data structure and calibration with respect to geolocation and time. Thus, we follow a unique approach to analyze how weather, season, climate, severe meteorological events, and vehicle capabilities influence if and how a road is passable. Driving on unpaved roads is also distracting and causes a higher cognitive load for users of navigation apps. Thus, we will add an adaptive user interface that takes into account how difficult it is to drive the current track. In total, we will enable a unique, more robust, user-friendly, and safer travel experience on challenging roads than with existing services. This is the first step towards assisted and semi-automatic
off-road driving, being exclusive to military and experimental vehicles today.
Bareways was founded in 2019 by Moritz von Grotthuss and Sascha Klement. The founders have a joint track record: they founded and established gestigon as a provider for gesture control solutions in the automotive market and successfully sold the company to the Valeo Group in 2017. Bareways benefits

polypoly,https://www.eu-startups.com/directory/polypoly-2/,Germany,"We’re building a European data economy that’s fair, transparent, and green.",Berlin,"data privacy, internet, data",Between €2.5 million-5 million,2019,https://polypoly.org/en-gb/,,,DE,"polypoly is a revolutionary economic system for data whose decentralised structure ensures the fair use of data without infringement of any user's rights. The core technology that makes this possible is the polyPod. Edge computing and the accompanying principle of decentralization are the key aspects of the polyPod. These in combination make for a highly scalable, secure and cost-efficient model. For the internet of things to be sustainable we need solid foundations - the polyPod makes sure that data never needs to leave the Wearable, Smart-Watch, car, or other IoT device that captures data in the first place. Thinking in this new paradigm allows developers to build features on top of the polyPod with the help of simple building blocks. Last but not least, this means a win-win for businesses too who can meaningfully reduce storage costs and eliminate those that have emerged as a result of GDPR - not to mention the risk of a data breach. At the same time, higher quality data insights are generated - from customers who don't have to give up their data. That’s what a profitable data exchange looks like with a polyPod user. 
The polyVerse, is the set of organizations behind polypoly. To empower the purpose-driven vision of inventing a new economic system for data, the polyVerse is comprised of three entities; The Foundation, The Enterprise and The Cooperative. All three entities serve a different function, yet are connected to ensure that the balance of interests combined goes into building a data economy that is efficient, privacy compliant and sustainable. 
polypoly Enterprise is focused on economic interests and the requirements of the economy, polypoly Foundation focuses on Government requirements and a regulatory framework for the fair use of data. polypoly Cooperative is citizen-focused and represents their interests, especially regarding wealth generated from their data. All three entities serve a different function yet the combination ensures that the balance never shifts in favor of one particular group's interests. All three entities keep each other in check to make sure the power balance is equally distributed.
polypoly Enterprise: Creates solutions for entrepreneurs Successful digital business models are based on data. But Europe is losing its data capital to foreign monopolies. European companies are currently dependent, gradually being deprived of access to business models that drive the digital economy. The solution: A decentralized data economy. polypoly Cooperative provides the technical basis – the polyPod. We develop tools and products for an easy transition to a decentralized data economy. Entrepreneurs will be able to liberate themselves from data monopolies, therefore protecting their existing models and building new digital ones.
polypoly Foundation: Understands the needs of public servants Europe is losing its data capital to foreign monopolies. As a result, European companies are cut off from their customers. Citizens' data privacy is unprotected, and European states are losing taxpayers‘ money. We assist governments to build a decentralized data economy for Europe. The technical infrastructure is provided by a cooperative of European citizens using the polyPod. The GDPR is baked into its code. The polyPod efficiently protects European citizens and frees European companies from dependence on data monopolies. It then follows that taxes on profits generated from European data capital are returned to Europe.
polypoly Cooperative: Represents the interests of all citizens The core idea of every cooperative is achieving more together. Together we can reclaim sovereignty over our data! We are developing the technical basis for a decentralised data economy: The polyPod, which belongs to all members of the Cooperative. The polyPod is available to all citizens enabling them to reclaim their data sovereignty. The polyPod stores user data on their personal end devices, which it never leaves. Citizens can choose how to make their data available, whether as a donation or for rent. If money is exchanged the cooperative receives a small percentage which is distributed to all cooperative members."

We combat the knowledge drain at foundries and metal companies. The expert knowledge is ""conserved"" and continuously increased. This means that the longer the technology is used, the smarter and more accurate the platform becomes.

Tracifier,https://www.eu-startups.com/directory/tracifier/,Germany,"Tracifier is a supply chain inspection data monitoring and tracking tool used for products and certificate verification built based on Blockchain technology. It tracks records from farms to the testing laboratory and finally releases the quality certificate of the tested products in the distributed ledger. That will help organisations who use the application to prove that their products are certified, and the documentation of their products have been checked and can be trusted. 

The aim is to speed up the exchange of information among suppliers in real-time and help to the sustainability of the product's claims by defining the exact origin, date, time, location, or major supplying activity details of products.",Hamburg,"Tracifier, TracifierSolutions, SupplychainTraceability,",Between €1-€100K,2019,https://tracifier.com/,,,DE,"Our mission is to guarantee consumer health in the market by reducing fraud in the food and certification market segment and bringing trust and transparency to the food value chain. We aim to build a fair consortium and incentivizes those users who contribute and fetch immutable data in efforts to improve food certification practices by compensating them for their information. Each user will have a unique cryptographic-encoded key (token) that guarantees access, tracks their data input history.
Tracifier provides food traceability solutions by digitalizing transactions and tracking products at each step of their supplying process. The solution creates an efficient way of working across the supply chain, including growers, processors, shippers, retailers, regulators, and consumers and benefits all network participants with a safer, intelligent, and more sustainable supply chain ecosystem.
Build on blockchain technology, Tracifier enables authorized users to access actionable food supply chain data, from farm to store and ultimately the consumer. The complete history and real-time location of any individual food item and following information such as certifications, test data, and temperature data gathered via IoT sticks are readily available in seconds once uploaded onto the blockchain. 
That provides participating companies with exceptional knowledge and a rich representation of the actual performance of the production processes. The possibility to share the common know-how about the supplying process improves the product and process performance with a combined approach, applicable not only to operational and production processes but also to the financial aspects that accompany the daily development of the business.
Delivering transparency and trust to the supply network, safer food, longer shelf lives, reduced waste, faster traceability, and better access to shared information, Tracifier empowers suppliers to meet the new standard for their supply chain management and deliver their practical and social promises to market."

While many of these developments are in their early stages, focused on solving technical and legislative issues, we look at what decentralisation means for decision-makers and propose creative solutions. Our twice monthly insight reports focus on specific industries and use cases affecting European public sectors, society, and enterprises.
After Gen X, characterised by big societal shifts, Gen Y (better known as millennials), and the digital native Gen Z, the decentralised generation (dGen) will grow up in a future shaped by different dynamics and technological developments.
The rise and progression of technologies such as artificial intelligence, blockchain, and IoT (internet of things) are ushering in a new type of digital transformation. These developments will individually bring disruption to many industries, but combined they have the potential to disrupt nearly everything. It is at the crossroads where we expect our whole socio-economic fabric to change.
Blockchain technology in particular has been adulated because of its promise to transform our digital lives with transparency, trust and accountability. This is a tool that will likely fuel a new generation of platforms and systems, across industries where value and data can be moved and distributed. AI, IoT, and blockchain technology to glue them together allow for an unprecedented decentralised generation - a force of dedicated and motivated minds who see blockchain as instruments that could trigger change.
Meanwhile, most blockchain developments are still in the early stages. Focusing on building solid products and exploring regulatory requirements that create a fertile yet safe environment for companies and investors. The industry’s focus is to solve the big topics right now, while we hear a lot of great ideas in the blockchain community about adoption. It’s time for those ideas to find a purpose and for the real decision-makers in the world to learn what decentralisation means for them.
""Artificial Intelligence, IoT, and blockchain technology to glue them together allow for an unprecedented decentralised generation""
dGen is a not-for-profit think tank based in Berlin, Germany. We focus on how blockchain technology can contribute to a decentralised future in Europe and what this might mean for people, society, private entities, and the public sector over the coming decades.
We are working with researchers and strategic partners to explore how decentralisation will shape our future. Two reports are scheduled for publication every month, focussing on specific industries to really drive ideas for adoption in Europe. We want the general public to start thinking about decentralisation beyond just digital currencies, and see the impact that decentralisation will have.
Our team and our creativity are inspired by a strong belief that through research and education, we can guide people, organisations and governments with the knowledge they need to build and thrive in a decentralised future.
We're currently open to expand our strategic partners in the public, private and blockchain sectors to support our mission in fostering adoption. If you or your organisation would like to get involved, please get in touch.

ASDRO,https://www.eu-startups.com/directory/asdro-gmbh/,Germany,"High-tech drone geophysics for efficient surveying, inspection and expert evaluation of surfaces and subsoils. With the help of drone technology, we analyse areas, buildings and structures of all kinds within the shortest possible time and with the highest precision. Visualised clearly and precisely to the centimetre.

The basis is drone geomagnetics with our highly specialized geophysical sensor technology, coupled with drone photogrammetry.

As a spin-off of the Institute of Geophysics of the University of Muenster, we have been operating mainly in the fields of application:
– UXO Detection
– Disturbing Body Detection
– Pipeline-Locating
– Archaeology
– 3D-Survey

Drone Geomagnetics:
With our self-developed drone geomagnetics method it is possible to detect e.g. explosive ordnance, ferrous contaminated sites, pipelines and current-carrying lines in the ground. A drone equipped with a magnetometer flies autonomously over a previously planned measurement area and measures the local magnetic field of the earth. Especially in areas that are difficult to access and for probing large areas, drone geomagnetics has an advantage over conventional methods.

Drone Photogrammetry:
The surveying and mapping of areas plays a decisive role in the cost calculation of construction projects. Especially the surveying of inaccessible areas was not possible or very cost-intensive until now.
Through the use of drones, these areas can be mapped and directly included in the construction planning within the framework of digitalisation.",Oberhausen,"Geophysics, Drones, Geomagnetics, Photogrammetry, UXO Detection",No funding announced yet,2019,https://asdro.de/,,,DE,

Using our sensor embedded shoe insole in combination with our smartphone application, patients learn to reintegrate correct walking patterns into their everyday life. This is achieved by giving haptic feedback about the current movement status in real time. Via the application, users receive individualized training suggestions.",Darmstadt,"parkinson, patients, sensors",,2018,www.novapace.de,,,DE,"Parkinson’s patients suffer from insecure walking - they show a short strided gait with a small foot
clearance. Due to their characteristic walking pattern, patients tend to stumble and fall, leading to
serious injuries (13 percent of all Parkinson’s patients require medical treatment due to falling each
year) and fear of further walking. Instead of keeping up physical activity to compensate for
Parkinsonian symptoms, the fear of falling keeps patients inside of their house and isolated from
social activities. Physical therapy helps Parkinson’s patients with this difficult task, but they struggle
with the implementation of the right walking techniques into everyday life.
The key to improving autonomy and quality of life in Parkinson’s patients is physical and medical
therapy. Novapace is an insole with embedded sensor and feedback unit, which serves as a 24/7
physical therapy unit. Thus, patients learn the right walking pattern on the go - it reminds them of the
correct techniques via a haptic feedback directly at the foot. Furthermore, they can see their training
progress on a mobile application.
Patient-related data collected by the device is optionally transferred to the physical therapist and
neurologist in order to validate the state of the disease and the therapy progress. It can serve as a
basis for the adaption of physical therapy techniques and medication, leading to individualized
therapy for each patient.
Novapace was initiated by Patrick Scholl during his Mechanical Engineering studies at Technische
Universität Darmstadt. Having a grandfather with Parkinson’s disease, he decided to support him
using his technological knowledge. Patrick won the third prize in the students’ category and a
special prize at the ideation competition at TU Darmstadt Startup and Innovation Day 2017. With the
support of Patricks co-founders Simon Staffa and Lukas Braisz, the project won the 2018 Global
Challenge Virtual Preliminary, which featured a trip to the Virginia Tech Global Entrepreneur
Challenge in the United States. Among 14 teams, the team won the Information Technology Award,
including prize money of 10000 Dollars.
The project was approved for the governmental funding scholarship “EXIST Business Start-up
Grant” (see www.exist.de/EN/ ) in September 2018. Until September of 2019, the team will optimize
and test the product and get into contact to possible investors.
Momentarily, a prototype (which is shown below) is evaluated within a scientific study at University
of Applied Sciences in Bremen. Physical therapy students test the applicability of novapace in
physical therapy within the scope of a group project. Therefore, gait analysis with and without
novapace is conducted. Outcomes of the study are implemented into the ongoing product
development. A following long-time evaluation with the next prototype generation is planned in the
scope of a Bachelor thesis."

Solution
The Manyfolds platform enables small and medium-sized businesses to instantly create and produce eco-friendly, size-optimized packaging.
Once the dimensions of the individual shipping goods are entered, the packaging incl. protective positioning inserts are automatically calculated within the WebApp. Customers order online or produce their packaging instantly through a copier-sized machine, fold them together, and place the individual items in recesses in the inlay. The goods are thereby ideally protected during shipment to the inside and outside, with no filling material needed.
With this solution, customers are significantly reducing overhead and packaging costs, minimizing shipping damage, eliminate filling material, and achieve better end customer reviews through better unboxing experiences.

Our Neo Enterprise Assistant Platform contains all the components, that, when used together, enable you to (a) build and configure your assistant, and (b) actually use your AI-assistant at work. With this platform you can essentially build any use-case you can think of.",Karlsruhe,"AI, future of work, Enterprise Assistant",,2018,https://neohelden.com/,,,DE,"Work is really complex due to the variety of software we use. If you look at software and machines today, youll realise that they work perfectly fine as long as theyre judged individually. However, if you think of each tool you use as an instrument, and would then listen to all the instruments play simultaneously, youd hear gibberish  and thats exactly what it feels like, if you work with a diverse set of software-systems and tools: Instead of focussing on meaningful work, you have to act as a director of your software-orchestra. So, managing a diverse set of software-systems and machines is a major challenge for employees: Its increasingly difficult to get actual work done instead of reading inboxes and yet another manual. We dont always know how to use the app that, but we also dont want to bother a specialist to again pull our budget-data from SAP. Thats why we built a tool that answers our questions in an easy way: the digital assistant Neo.
Neo is an AI-based virtual assistant platform that integrates into your tool-set and immediately starts aggregating and summarising information from your tools. And voila, your calendar, to-do-lists and inboxes are in sync, meetings are being prepared and scheduled automatically, and the latest report is just a question away.
From a technical point of view, Neo is cross-platform and cross-device, which allows our customers to use Neo on their phones (Android and iOS) and also on their desktop-PCs (Windows and Mac OS). This also enables Neo to deliver and understand information in the right context, and to bridge the gap between smartphones and PCs (e.g. receiving a command on mobile phone to open an Excel-file on desktop).
With Neo, everybody can benefit from a personal assistant. Neos usability across devices is underpinned by using a conversational interface (a.k.a. chatbots), whereby content becomes the visual (or auditive) medium itself and interactions with Neo actually feel like real conversations you could have had with a human-assistant. With our workflow-automation-system, we can automate (and semi-automate) a lot of routine-tasks (such as creating new listings, editing listings, review-processes, expose-creation) and integrate into various b2b-systems (such as SAP, Oracle, onOffice). We have a natural language understanding and intent-recognition algorithm, that can also run on your own servers (so no connection to an external cloud is needed). We are able to integrate systems using 18 different programming languages."

In the meantime, we have already launched five products in the cosmetics and food sectors.",Haselund,"disruptivetechnologies, hyaluronicacid, biopolymers, chitosan",Between €1 million-€ 2.5 million,2017,https://www.fundernation.eu/investments/solyplus-gmbh?lang=en,Active,https://www.linkedin.com/company/solyplus-gmbh/,DE,"SolyPlus GmbH, founded in Berlin in 2017, is a start-up biotechnology company based in Haselund, Nordfriesland, since 2020.
SolyPlus technology makes it possible to improve numerous products and develop new ones forcosmetics, pharmaceuticals and medtech use. We are a team of experienced experts dedicated to developing new sustainable products to overcome unmet medical needs for a healthier future.
Products
Chitosan is a fungal biopolymer with strong anti-viral and anti-bacterial properties. In order to use this property as additional protection against viral infections (including coronaviruses) in the oral pharynx, we looked for dosage forms that would keep chitosan in the mouth for as long as possible, e.g. chewing gums and candies. Chitosan-containing chewing gums and candies were developed and brought to market in cooperation with specialist companies from the food industry (GoBeDo GmbH and Heller & Strauss GmbH). We are also currently developing chitosan sprays together with the companies Ursatec GmbH (developer) and Förde Ventures GmbH (financier). The entire program includes nasal, throat and skin sprays with development costs of approximately € 2.5 million. These medical products are expected to enter the human market in 2024. The hobby animal market can also benefit from these hygiene sprays, especially because Förde Ventures, through its chief executive, Volker Haak, has close ties with the local hobby animal company Trixie Heimtierbedarf GmbH & Co. KG in Tarp.
Another example of the application of our technology is the use of hyaluronic acid for cosmetics and medical deices in the form of defined microparticles, films, microneedles and implants with significant product benefits, which was not possible before. Our first cosmetic product ""Hyalu-Pearls"" contains 1.7% of a particularly strong water-binding hyaluronic acid, which would correspond to a normal hyaluronic acid of approx. 5%. Hyalu-Pearls uses hard hyaluronic acid microparticles as an exfoliating element, thus combining the exfoliating effect with the skin care effect in a brilliant way. Our second product, ""Hyalu-Pearls 10%"", even contains 10% hyaluronic acid (mass/ml), which is a world first. Both products can be used as a exfoliation and anti-wrinkle agent with high effectiveness. An Aloe Vera Gel is planned to follow in summer 2022 to expand our cosmetic line (SolyPure Cosmetics).
Our focus in the future will be on medical applications of our technology and the products made with it: For example, self-dissolving wound dressings and orthopedic material as well as microneedles for painless vaccination, all made from pure hyaluronic acid. With the prototypes already in place, SolyPlus is in negotiation with several German specialist companies who are very interested in taking over further development and marketing.
The scope of application of SolyPlus technology is not limited to the development of medical and cosmetic products or the aforementioned hyaluronic acid. The most diverse areas of application, e.g. in agriculture, 3D printing technology, ski wax improvement, lubricant developments, internal coating of gloves and booties, etc. are also conceivable.
USPs
SolyPlus' basic technology and application areas are broadly protected by 5 patent families (plus patent family relating to chitosan). The basic patent has already been granted in USA and Europe as well as two additional application patents in USA and India. This enables SolyPlus to develop completely new products that did not exist before due to the non-existing manufacturing technology. Examples are the microneedles, wound dressings and implants made of pure hyaluronic acid with significant product advantages.
Business model and distribution
SolyPlus is the thinktank that demonstrates the feasibility of new innovative products. The development of such products up to market maturity, as well as the approval and marketing are carried out by our licensees. We participate in the subsequent market success of the products through upfront and milestone payments as well as royalties. This applies to the dosage forms containing chitosan (chewing gums, candies, teas and soon also nasal, throat and skin sprays).
This concept enables rapid upscaling with manageable fixed costs.
The cosmetic products mentioned above are sold through the Amazon FBA Platform and our own webshop by our own cosmetic brand (SolyPure Cosmetics). In order to increase our sales, we have engaged suitable agencies in Germany and US in January 2022."

QUASA replaces all traditional forms of logistics platforms, making logistics system more transparent, clear, cost effective and fast.
QUASA provides a platform-marketplace for the dissemination of digital templates of contracts and agreements that have real legal value and validity in the blockchain environment.
Each module for a certain type of transportation passes a single development cycle, consisting of a number of stages:
- Standardization of the order process
- Standardization of the service delivery process
- Standardization of the transaction process
QUASA issues its own currency, the QUASA token (QUA), which will be required to interact with the QUASA platform to pay for services.
Token worth: 1 ETH = 3,000 QUA
QUASA offers a standardized API for building private ratings.
The basic economy of QUASA meets two main criteria:
- minimum volatility
- competitive cost of services
To ensure minimum volatility, tariffs are introduced for transactions and services of the QUASA blockchain-environment using the XDR (SDR) index. The IMF daily publishes the ratio of the XDR index (SDR) to the world's 20 major currencies.
To use all modules and full functionality in QUASA, each connected company will need to use a set of services provided by the platform.
Payment methods are variable; the commission for services can be collected in percentage, be fixed, and can consist of any combination. There may be a zero commission, or there may be a commission payment at the expense of the seller, as in modern credit cards. In addition, ‘reverse commissions’ are possible - material encouragement of users for transactions.
QUASA is now a partner of BestRate that means all currency is acceptable during the ICO.
We have different ways to influence the growth in the value of QUA: each connected company is an information guide, every successful one is an even larger, louder information guide. Every time a company starts taking QUA, this is good news. We have a lot of such companies, and there will be many positive news, we will be constantly on hearing and will be able to influence the course.
The value of our currency will be provided by the real services provided by the QUASA platform, which will change the idea of cargo transportation."

Our goal is to change the image of sustainable, fair and locally produced fashion through a carefully curated selection of products. The fashion industry has changed rapidly in recent years. Collections are changing more frequently than ever before and global textile consumption has doubled since 2000. More and more items of clothing that are moving from the rack to the closet and from the closet to the container have set in motion a colossal process of alienation: fashion no longer means anything to us. And has become disposable. What does that leave behind? Mountains of discarded clothing that was produced far away because it was as cheap as possible. How a garment is made who worked on it under what conditions – that is hardly comprehensible. What is certain is that the clothing industry ranks second in the ranking of environmental sinners, just behind the oil industry. Sustainable fashion can be a way out, but it still has to contend with a crooked image: fair clothing and high fashion are mutually exclusive. the wearness wants to change the previous perception of ethically impeccable luxury. We want to offer fashion-conscious customers a positive shopping alternative - aesthetic, uncomplicated, but with a clear conscience.

Artificial intelligence and autonomous robots will do most of our tasks automatically.
Goods will be as favorable as never before. Abundance is normal for some people. Others, however, find no tasks, no opportunities to create prosperity through employment.
The gap between the rich and the poor blows the societies around the world.

Tomorrows working world is a world where we do something because we want to do it.
And yet it will also remain the world in which we look for recognition and earn income to fulfill our desires.
Self-realisation becomes more easily possible, but making a living remains important.
Talenter.io is the platform for this.

Much faster than everyone thinks, the artificial intelligence will do all the jobs. We really mean ALL(!) jobs.
Doctor, truck drivers, pilots, managers, Tax Consultants, Lawyers, Authorities-employees, Officials and even CEOs.
AI is always more efficient, faster and always makes the right decisions.

The AI replaces us in just a few years,takes away what constitutes ""humanity"": To be used.
This creates a unique need and a gigantic business.

Our solution: Talenter.io",Stuttgart,"AI, automation robots",,2017,https://www.talenter.io,,,DE,"Talenter.io offers for the first time an solution that enables people to provide human services beyond the usual professional standards. Talenter.io is to offer the world a completely new and urgently needed labor market. A billion-dollar market!
Today, if only every unemployed person in the world offers an hour of talent for one dollar, the added value of 1.2 trillion dollars/year is generated. An added value that is currently withheld from all these people! That is the state of play today. Over the next five to fifteen years, up to 40% of today's jobs will fall victim to automation and artificial intelligence. Soon the Talenter market will not be a billion-dollar market, a one hundred billion-dollar market.
Population density is key for Talenters success:
The world did Talenter the favour to concentrate people in spots. More than 54% of worlds population lives in urban areas.
Talenter will focus on metropoles the first years. To this end, we have developed a sophisticated hub marketing strategy.
A small booking fee of 5% guaranteed steady income.
Talenter will gain steady income independend of momentarely TLT courses because a service is probably offered on Talenter.io in a TLT equivalent of 5 Dollar in average.
Our business plan is to grow successively. As described above, we will use the developed hub marketing strategy to develop one metropolis after another and build up local employees there as well. If we are successful, expansion will continue. We are therefore extremely cautious with liquid funds and will definitely lead talenter.io to great success. If in doubt, it only takes longer, but it will happen.
Internationalization:
A sophisticated plan has already been developed as to which metropolises we will tackle one after the other.
Competition:
Shared Economy Market is ripe for Blockchain Approach
Etsy, Fiverr, TaskRabbit, Uber are like Talenter in gig economy. And also when they arent direct competitors they are good indicators for Talenters market.
Etsy, fiverr and TaskRabbit are making approximately a 312 million Dollar turn-over.
The already existing gig market represents a great opportunity for a blockchain solution. Even more if one think about the near future.
Blockchain technology is going to make purchase processes manyfold easier. And so far convenience was always a strong argument for users.

Novoline im Internet spielen mit Sofortspielen

Eine weitere Möglichkeit, Novoline im Internet spielen zu können, sind Sofortspiele, die von verschiedenen Internetplattformen angeboten werden. Dort kann der User sich mit Spielgeld so richtig austoben und schauen, welcher Slot ihm am meisten Freude bereitet. Passend dazu gibt es noch eine Variante, sie Spielautomaten von Novoline zu spielen, wenn es sich dabei auch nicht um Novoline im Internet spielen handelt. Dabei hat der User die Möglichkeit, sich Games entweder einzeln oder im Paket auf den Computer herunter zu laden. Dann kann er es installieren und hat jederzeit die Möglichkeit, es zu nutzen.

Novoline im Internet spielen um echtes Geld oder um Spielgeld

Natürlich muss jeder User sich überlegen, ob er lieber um Spaßgeld spielen will oder doch lieber echtes Geld einsetzen möchte. Für beide Varianten gibt es Vor- und auch Nachteile. Natürlich ist immer ein Risiko dabei, wenn echtes Geld eingesetzt wird. Dafür kann der Spieler auch Gewinne aus Echtgeld einfahren und sie auszahlen lassen. Im Gegenzug spielt der User mit Spielgeld folgerichtig ohne Risiko und hat nicht das Problem, sein Geld verspielen zu müssen. Tja, wie viel Risiko jeder bereit ist einzugehen, muss natürlich individuell entschieden werden.

Bei einer Einzahlung auf den Bonus achten

Wer Novoline im Internet spielen will und einzahlen möchte, sollte sich über verschiedene Bonusangebote informieren. User haben hier die Chance, von erheblichen Budgeterhöhungen zu profitieren, mit denen höhere Einsätze und in der Folge auch höhere Gewinne möglich sind. Dabei sollten Nutzer nicht nur auf die Höhe des Bonus' achten, sondern sich auch die Bonusbedingungen durchlesen. Nur so ist es möglich, die Angebote miteinander zu vergleichen. Denn nur weil der maximale Bonusbetrag besonders hoch ist, ist das Angebot nicht extrem gut.

Die Einzahlung vornehmen und Novoline im Internet spielen

Support agents have to answer the same questions and processes every day. This is not only bad for companies but also bad for their clients since they often have to wait minutes or even hours in a hotline or have to wait days for an email reply. For this reason, Customer Service is one of the first departments to be outsourced. We believe this presents a missed opportunity as it is a direct link to the customers and their concerns.
The customer demand for fast service on more and more channels is steadily increasing, however, it is extremely costly for companies to meet this demand. This challenge is only compounded by the fact that the distribution of requests is highly-volatile, so that support capacity is either not permanently used or processing times are unsatisfactory for customers at peaks.
We bring practical applications of Deep Learning and AI to customer service and help companies achieve greater customer service efficiency. The system analyses inbound messages, sends them to the right department, and provides agents with accurate response suggestions. This reduces average handling time up to 80% and automates more and more responses and processes. The e-bot7 system is based on complex NLP algorithms (Convolutional Neural Networks, LSTMs) trained on historical customer service scripts. The NLP is constantly optimised during operation so that more and more requests can be processed more efficiently."

In the EU and U.S. alone there are 1.7 million cases of colic reported every year, of which 7 percent will face life threatening complications. The value of horses lost to colic in the U.S. is assessed at $70 million with the total cost to the industry is estimated at $144 million p.a. In the EU, the cost to the industry is estimated at 245 million.
Currently, there are no effective monitoring solutions on the market to protect the welfare of horses today. Horse owners and care givers are unable to monitor the wellness of their horse 24x7. Regular visits by the horse owner together with routine veterinary inspection is currently the only way to monitor horses today. While it is generally accepted that most equine disorders and diseases can be successfully treated if early veterinary intervention is sought, veterinarians (let alone owners) currently have no instrument to monitor sick or injured horses in real time."

Wikilerts.com,https://www.eu-startups.com/directory/wikilerts-com/,Germany,"Wikilerts is a combination of the words Wiki (community-driven content) and Alerts (relevant notifications).

On Wikilerts, users set up alert communities in the format ""Get alerted if ... XYZ happens"" . Interested users can join the community and keep each other informed by reporting an alert as soon as XYZ happens.
 
This is how it works: http://www.wikilerts.com/secret/about

The case for Wikilerts:
Today there is a massive lack of specific alert services. There are tons of feeds you can subscribe to (RSS feeds, newsletters, Twitter-feeds etc.) however they send you too much content. On Wikilerts, you can get alerted - and only alerted - about the specific happenings which you are interested in.

For example, a user can set up the alert community ""Get alerted if there is a new startup in the tracking and alerts space"" - something we'd be interested in for example :) See a list of this type of alert communities at http://www.wikilerts.com/secret/search=newstartup. Everybody can report alerts, and selected community members get asked to check those before they get sent out to everybody. This ensures that no spam is sent.

Also: everybody can set up alerts for the happenings he'd like to get alerted about (without committing to be the one who sends the alerts later) - where else is that possible today?  

We believe that this process will lead to many, many specific alert communities getting set up so that nobody has to worry about missing out on specific things anymore. Links to alert communities on wikilerts.com will be all over the net in 3-5 years from now.",Berlin,"alert, notification, customization",,2015,http://www.wikilerts.com/secret/,,,DE,

R3DT offers the most user-friendly Virtual Reality (VR) tool for industrial engineering. The innovative technology for working with virtual prototypes is used along the entire development process. Particular attention is paid to planning errors that are difficult to identify without VR. Our customers’ applications include work and assembly planning, ergonomics study, determination of assembly sequences, overall production and layout planning, special machinery and plant construction as well as technical purchasing and sales. Overall, the development and planning phases are shortened. Elaborate mockups and real prototypes become superfluous. The bottom line is that companies save a lot of time and money.
Our customers include Albemarle, Alcon/Ciba Vision, Bizerba, Bosch, Bürkert, Continental, Daimler, Eberspaecher, ebm-papst, Elabo, Festo, GHH Fahrzeuge, Harting, Hosokawa-Alpine, Hydro Systems, Iscar, Josera Erbacher, Kadia, Koenig & Bauer, Netzsch, Romaco, Rexroth, Schnaithmann, Sesotec, Sick, Sonotronic, Tesat-Spacecom, Trumpf, Valeo, Wieland-Werke and ZF Friedrichshafen.
Smart planning and presentation with virtual functional prototypes
R3DT's VR tool is started and operated by users themselves, anywhere and at any time within a few minutes. So, anyone can automatically generate virtual prototypes from 3D CAD data at the push of a button. Immediately afterwards, with VR glasses and your bare hands (instead of annoying controllers), you can work virtually at planned workstations, production lines or machines, or you present in a 360-degree all-round view. Together with co-workers and business partners, critical design reviews and virtual assembly processes become possible quickly and anywhere. Ergonomics checks can also be carried out at a very early stage in order to assess the physical stress situation at the respective workplace. Some use cases of the VR tool are described here: https://www.r3dt.com/en/use-cases-and-references.
We make daily life easier for industrial engineers
From the user's point of view, the simple use of the VR tool from R3DT without previous knowledge or training is decisive: Thanks to intuitive operation by means of unique hand interaction (powered by Ultraleap), the 3D models can be experienced at any time as in real 1:1. No matter whether in the factory hall, at the designer’s desk, in the meeting room with co-workers and business partners, at the trade fair or at the on-site appointment of technical buyers and sellers. The single-seat software license currently costs only 5,880 euros per year and often pays for itself with the first use.
Would you like to get to know and test the VR software from R3DT?
Let's call first! You can reach us by phone at +49-721-96495174 or by e-mail at
[email protected] . If everything fits, we will be pleased to visit you and let your team test the VR tool using own 3D CAD models. If you already have the necessary VR hardware such as HTC Vive or Oculus Rift for example, we can send you a test license at any time without obligation. In case of need, new VR hardware can be leased worldwide or purchased from about 2,500 euros. We are happy to support you in your selection!
About R3DT: High-tech from the land of ideas
The team of R3DT GmbH around mechanical engineer Andreas Ruedenauer, software developer Julien Kipp and business economist Achim Schneider started as a spin-off from the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT). The VR software was developed in 2016/17 in the CyberLab, the IT accelerator of the state of Baden-Wuerttemberg. Today, the software company has its offices in the Technologiefabrik Karlsruhe. In addition to the founders, Germany's largest seed investor, High-Tech Gruenderfonds (HTGF), is also involved. Further information can be found at https://www.r3dt.com/en.

The algorithm and all the descriptions were created during an evidence-based research and development process that took us about 12 months. Early features were designed and tested with the help from friendly HR practitioners. Since going online with our first version in late summer of 2015, we have developed enhanced features enabling instant cross comparisons, the automated translation into job specific competencies from the TMA competency library and the mapping of jobs to leading compensation surveys used globally through our own compensation survey Rosetta Stone.
We are fully bootstrapped and have dispensed with external funds. We subsequently financed the company entirely from our own resources. Thus we have learned from the outset to operate economically and effectively. We can therefore focus on developing an independent business with the best product and most convenient customer service out there.
During the development of the software, we consistently focused on working with excellent designers and developers and proved a great deal of skill in product development through the early involvement of friendly users and first customers.
As the vendor of the application we have developed a ""Technical Sales"" approach. When an interested party calls they will immediately talk to someone who knows our product and the practice of job evaluation. If someone wants to check out the system themselves, they can do so by accessing the website and signing up for an only time-limited evaluation account.

SEMFOX GmbH,https://www.eu-startups.com/directory/semfox-gmbh/,Germany,"Internet users often feel unsatisfied when using a product search engine: they always have the feeling that the search engine isn't understanding them the right way because of wrong search results or missing items in the result set discovered later by the user.

Milk the Sun,https://www.eu-startups.com/directory/milk-the-sun/,Germany,"Since its launch in March 2012, www.MilktheSun.com has been successfully connecting major players in the photovoitaic (PV) field by providing a platform where landowners, developers, EPCs as well as investors and independent service providers can communicate & exchange information in a direct and transparent format.

The ability to connect potential investors directly with planners and developers of PV installation projects or with owners of existing solar energy installations, eliminates the complexity and expense of surplus brokers in the investment chain. Milk the Sun uses the inherent transparency & sophistication of todays modern technology to provide both time & cost savings to project owners & investors in comparison to existing conventional methods. With its comprehensive platform, Milk the Sun aims to optimize market place transparency so that potential investors are confident that they are paying the correct price for the installations & accompanying services they choose to invest their capital in. With this new, innovative approach Milk the Sun also aims to promote PV installations as a viable & sustainable asset class for todays discerning investor.

This innovative business idea was born directly out of the frustration of its founders wish to eliminate the hidden broker fees which not only made the cost of investing in this sustainable asset class artificially inflated but also made the investment process very time-consuming for potential investors  thus inhibiting the growth of the PV installation market as a profitable yet sustainable investment option. With this new concept, the founders aim to replicate the success of the real estate market as a viable and trusted investment asset.

Milk the Suns target market is both PV installation projects in the planning/implementation phase and also existing, mature PV installations. Europe already has approx. 1.8 million PV installations in operation and 1.2 million of those are situated in Germany, with the market still experiencing significant growth.
