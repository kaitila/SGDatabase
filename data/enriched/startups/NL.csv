Grasple,https://www.eu-startups.com/directory/grasple/,Netherlands,"Grasple offers an ethical, EU-based alternative to Big Tech AI tools by giving educators control and students trustworthy, personalised STEM learning pathways, while bridging the skills gap with free, high-quality, adaptive resources created by a community of educators, while optimising operations for teachers and institutions in delivering STEM edcuation.","In Europe, we pride ourselves on fairness, access, and opportunity — yet today, 80% of learners experience maths anxiety, and only 20% feel confident in mastering it. This is not just a classroom issue. It's a social and economic crisis.
At Grasple, we are a social enterprise with a mission: to democratise STEM education, starting with numeracy and data literacy. Why? Because a lack maths skills costs Europe billions annually in lost productivity and career potential. This widens the gap between those who can participate in modern society and those who can't.
We’re not here to add another flashy AI product. We are building Europe’s AI tutor for STEM — an open, transparent, ethical, and educator-driven platform. Unlike typical black-box AI tools, Grasple is built with educators and powered by evidence-based pedagogy. It’s already trusted by 35 institutions, impacting over 135,000 students and growing steadily with 15% year-on-year growth.
We’re not theorising. We’ve proven our tech, proven our traction, and proven we can scale. We combine adaptive algorithms, open educational resources, and collaborative tooling to meet every student exactly where they are. And we do this while keeping access free for individuals, because we believe education should empower — not exclude.
The business model is solid: institutions pay, learners don’t. We have 18 long-term contracts — some up to 11 years — and a current ARR of €640,000. Our target market in higher education is €250 million annually across the EU, UK, and US.
But this is not just about market share. It’s about impact. About reskilling a 38-year-old mechanic who, thanks to Grasple, aced a maths exam and found confidence in his new engineering journey. That’s real transformation. That’s the European way — inclusive, purposeful, and future-oriented.
We are raising €1.3 million for product development — to build multi-language support, adaptive learning via KC graphs with knowledge tracing and AI tutor,  deepen the github for educators to collaborate with each other across the world on Open STEM content and increase the options to quickstart for teachers to get even more value out of Grasple in an instance and give their students help. We’re also seeking €700k to scale our reach through community-driven growth and ethical marketing.
We don’t just want your capital. We want your alignment. Your belief in the power of open education, in sovereignty in AI, and in building something sustainable, not just profitable.
Let’s build the future of learning in Europe — together.""",Amsterdam,Edtech STEM AI-tutor,No funding announced yet,2018,https://www.grasple.com/,Active,NL,https://www.linkedin.com/in/elisabethschmoutziguer/

Voltti,https://www.eu-startups.com/directory/voltti/,Netherlands,"I have created a software programme for companies that will attract and retain autistic talent in the tech field.  This project is called Voltti, and by using this name it encapsulates the concept, to ""flip"" the traditional recruitment process on its head, by putting the candidate in control of the process, whilst virtually eliminating the social contact usually utilised by HR.  The application will be fully accessible and will adhere to ethical use of AI, as well as having a inclusive data set within the AI.","The problem: traditional hiring practices are barriers to employment for autistic adults. I have created a solution that removes this barrier.
The solution: I have created a software programme for companies that will make it easier for companies to attract and retain autistic talent in the tech field using AI for the text and video
sections of the recruitment process.  
I have chosen activities that are far more engaging than typical workplace assessments, such as alternative and creative ways for each candidate to express themselves on a more personal level. This information would be shared among their team members and the existing employees will also share their creative output with the candidate towards the end of the process.  Also, there will elements utilized within the programme to be more inclusive and understanding of those who think outside the box, and will not offer typical responses to questions or assessments as these need to specifically worded in a way that is more appealing and better understood by neurodiverse individuals.  Typical interview processes and unconscious bias typically are barriers to employment for those on the spectrum. Thus, by removing these we can provide increased access to the workforce, and companies can benefit by recruiting people in an untapped talent pool making a social impact.
My software programme also allows for the candidate to interview the company, to find out more in depth information about the culture, their potential coworkers, their manager, and the company’s stance on diversity and inclusion. What supports are in place?  Are there ERG’s?  All of this type of information would be easily accessible to the candidate, and they can review this information on their own time.  Also built into the programme is support for each candidate to ensure their needs are met, and to address any anxiety or other issues they may encounter along the way.  The candidate is able to save and return to the process at any time.
Autism awareness training is an integral part of this programme, as there are too many myths and misconceptions about autism, these can be easily and efficiently be dismissed if the appropriate training is provided.  Accommodations for the employee will be set up prior to beginning the job, and this “passport” can be updated and edited at any time, so will follow the employee throughout their career so that new coworkers are aware of the individual needs. Onboarding processes will also be covered here, therefore reducing the need for such a  large HR department, streamlining the process and getting more autistic adults into jobs.
•	All staff who work on this project will be neurodiverse.
•	This is in the idea stage.
The cornerstone of the programme is built upon the UN SDG’s for equal employment and pay, and equality for the social good.

Agcurate BV,https://www.eu-startups.com/directory/agcurate-bv/,Netherlands,"We are a 3-year old, mostly bootstrapped supercalifragilisticexpialidocious Dutch startup, founded by Turkish and Azerbaijani nationals; operating in agritech, offering AI tools to Food Producers, specifically those who do contract farming.

Via our AI co-pilot FieldOps, we help Food Producers to monitor their ROI on agricultural operations consistently, by providing them with actionable insights on their fields using satellite imagery and AI.","Food Producers globally rely on planned and calculated flow of the ingredients to produce the food we love to consume on a daily basis. 
They have to monitor their investment constantly and they have to make sure the farmers have enough resources and knowledge to cultivate the promised yield. 
As a result, they do their best to have a 360 view of their operations. Yet, the area is too big.
In order to monitor thousands of hectares of cultivated land, agriculture operations teams spend about fourteen thousand hours per season traveling about 20 thousand kilometers per month for 4-6 months. 
To put it into perspective, that’s the distance between Berlin and Prague traveled 3 times. Per day!
Apart from this, resources are limited and have to be used according to a strict planning; For example, the water waste accumulated from incorrect irrigation is in itself a financial burden, as well as it can damage the yield and may result in degradation of soil.
In addition to that, the climate doesn’t help either. Climate change has adverse effects on agriculture globally on so many levels. For example, changing weather conditions make the whole operation volatile with sudden drought or frost or floods. Or rising CO2 may result in bigger yields in some regions but it decreases the nutritional value of the crops overall.
In light of these, it is pretty clear that to cover the entirety of the operations doing only manual work is costly and massively time consuming.
We overcome all of these challenges and provide even more to our customers by simply focusing on Satellite Imageries, or a.k.a Earth Observation Technology and combining it with AI. 
Combining the strength of this data medium with the surrounding product, FieldOps, with all of its underlying tools, we bring the 360 view of the entirety of the operation into the fingertips of organizations.
Based on our calculations, FieldOps can divide the time they spend traveling into half, save them 10-20% of their expenditure on agricultural operations and make sure they plan ahead of unforeseen challenges.
Using satellite imagery and AI, FieldOps monitors croplands on a daily basis and provides insights both during the season and at the end of it. 
Currently, we are proficient on eight crops, providing AI-powered insights on them across multiple regions in two countries.
We are currently looking at doing 3 research projects this year on understanding two crops in three different regions with our potential customers.
In 2024, our key aim is to extend our services to analyzing crops in Eastern Europe, Asia and Africa, covering 12 different crops. 
We are two founders with a small team of 4 people who work in the intersection of remote sensing, software engineering, AI, product and business development. 
Berk Ulker, oversees the AI and machine learning operations at the company. He has 9 years corporate work experience in AI-based technologies and he is currently finishing his Ph.D studies in AI in Eindhoven University in the same field as Agcurate.
Metin Emenullahi, coming from Computer Science background and mostly working in the technical side, has been a startup entrepreneur for approximately 12 years now. He oversees product management, finance and strategy at the company. 
We also constantly collaborate with the academy and researchers. These researchers help us on various matters from agronomy to AI, from getting field and crop information to providing us with a consultation on various topics of science. 
We are currently raising a pre-seed round to fund our efforts until PMF. We’ll use the funds to finance mainly our sales & marketing teams and operations, while also covering the cost of revenue by fueling product development. 
In our efforts to reach PMF, we expect to onboard 50 customers with approximately 10000 ha of land under management.",Arnhem,"Agritech, AI, food producers, field operations",Between €1-€100K,2023,agcurate.com,Active,NL,https://linkedin.com/company/agcurate

Dr AI is a term used to describe artificial intelligence systems that are designed to support healthcare professionals in delivering personalized care.

As healthcare technology advances, AI's role in addressing some of the challenges confronting the Dutch healthcare system is likely to become even more important. Dr AI implementation can provide a variety of benefits to both patients and healthcare providers, including: 
Enhanced access to care: Patients can receive medical advice and support more quickly and easily by using AI-powered virtual consultations, reducing wait times and increasing access to care.
Improved efficiency and accuracy: AI technology can quickly analyze enormous volumes of data to give clinicians more precise and pertinent information about a patient's health, enabling them to make better decisions and administer better care.
Dr. AI can assist medical professionals in managing their workload more efficiently by taking on mundane duties like triage, giving up their time to concentrate on more difficult patients.

Whado is an online platform for activities and events. Our aim is to be the number one platform that connects people and activities, no matter where they are in the world. You can expect from us that your next adventure is always within reach. That means no longer having to search for hours for an activity or outing, but being able to choose directly from the total picture. Whether you're looking for an afternoon at the zoo, an escape room or a walk through nature, Whado has you covered!
How does it work?
Whado is a controlled community driven platform. This means that our team, as well as the users and the providers of the activities can contribute to the content of the platform. For example, we encourage companies to supplement and actively maintain information about their activity, and users can in turn share their experiences via Whado with others. In this way we ensure that all users benefit from our platform!
Where did it start?
Whado was born from the own needs of founders Lars van den Bosch and Marcel van Nuil. Abroad, the two former college friends, who have been successfully doing business together in the field of software development for many years, regularly noticed how difficult it can be to find activities in a well-organized manner. The main reason for this turned out to be the lack of transparency of other advertising-driven commercial platforms. They saw a gap in the market in a reliable and objective platform. And so it happened. With the aim of transparently offering activities and outings worldwide, Marcel and Lars founded Whado in February 2021 from their office in Zwolle. Not only clear and easy to use, but also free for all parties involved.
The two entrepreneurs initially started with a focus on the Netherlands, but now they can proudly say that Whado has crossed the Dutch border long and wide. With an enthusiastic team of seven passionate adventurers and developers, Lars and Marcel work hard every day to make Whado a worldwide success. The founders are also the owners of parent company NewHeap, a full-service software development company that specializes in developing comprehensive software solutions and applications. With this knowledge in their pocket, they ensure that Whado is expanded daily with new features that make the platform even more user-friendly.
Win win
With accessibility for everyone as an important core value, Whado creates a win-win situation. By submitting your activity or event on our platform, the platform can grow and we learn from the content. In exchange for you entering, completing and keeping your activity or event up-to-date, we make sure that you are found well. Not only on Whado, but also on platforms such as the various well-known search engines, hotels, tourist and information points. Our platform is now available in four languages and provided with complete practical information about the activities.

Users can filter on locations that will be warmer than 15 degrees Celsius in winter. Another example is a filter that will show all locations that are in the EU timezone.

This way users will see way more relevant reviews, not those of anyone but specifically from remote workers. The platform will constantly publish articles about cool locations and experiences of remote workers to inspire its users. Also, tips and knowledge will be shared to adapt to the remote worker lifestyle.

“The greatest danger in times of turbulence is not the turbulence; it is to act with yesterday’s logic” -Peter Drucker.
During the unprecedented months of COVID-19 pandemic; many patients including known heart failure patients and post acute coronary syndrome patients across the world were unable to receive the necessary medical attention from their healthcare professionals, because most of the healthcare systems in the world were simply flooded with COVID-19 patients. MedCor solution was born due to the urgent medical necessities of all patients including COVID-19 patients.
Our vision is to create a secure telemonitoring system to connect patients and their vitals directly to their healthcare professional and hospital’s Electronic Health Records (EHR) by using HL7 protocols. We followed a strict criteria to select only clinically approved, high quality home monitoring devices such as contactless thermometers, blood pressure, saturation and body composition monitors. The result is MedCor4U mobile based application with secure connectivity to various devices and at the same time user friendly.
By implementing the MedCor4U telemonitoring system you can connect your patients to your medical staff and EHR using a scalable, secure and affordable system. We take privacy very seriously, patients can see and/or export their data any time they wish.
Our mission is helping your patients to receive guideline based therapies at home using clinically approved monitoring devices. Connecting their vitals to your EHR in a secure way.
Together we can reduce the monitoring burden on healthcare systems worldwide and provide the needed healthservices on the right time in the right place, close to the patients, even at home.",Landsmeer,"E-Health, Telemonitoring, Med Tech, EHR integration",No funding announced yet,2021,www.themedcompany.com,,NL,
Segro,https://www.eu-startups.com/directory/segro/,Netherlands,Stop bad habits with agenda insights. Get the lifestyle you want.,"Today I finally launch! This is my experience from 5 months ago till now.
I announced almost 5 months ago that I want to launch 12 startups in 12 months. Now, 5 months later, I'm launching the first.
For the past few months, I've been mulling over whether I should adjust my goals and whether I am too ambitious. But I don't want to give in to that just yet. I just decided to move my goal of releasing 12 startups in 12 months, so the start is now!
I have been reflecting a lot from the start (the moment I packed my things in the Netherlands and left everything behind). I also did that just before departure, when I still had my permanent job and my home in the Netherlands.
I kept a record of everything I did in my calendar. I described my feeling at the end of the week, reflecting on the last 7 days, going from week to week. Continuous evaluation.
Strangely enough, keeping my calendar was very easy. I think Apple's Calendar app works great, both on my iPhone and on my Macbook.
But reflecting was time consuming. Open my calendar every time and add everything together. And that of every event in my calendar. But the results are very important to me: a clear overview of how I organize my life. This makes me very self-conscious.
Subsequently, during my trip in Spain, in addition to the projects that I take on myself (on behalf of Varchar), I also started freelancing 1 day a week. I kept track of my hours, again in my calendar. A new month arrived, and it was time to send an invoice for the work. Again, I took out my calendar and started adding everything up. Time consuming and error prone.
The startup I'm launching this month is based on the issues I had while reflecting and sending the invoice. The app provides insights into your calendar. Your lifestyle, your good and bad habits, your freelance work, or other time registrations that are important to you. Immediately visible.
The app “Segro”, derived from “Self Growth”, is currently only available for Apple/iOS.

In our experience this is also the only way that you can do product design and develop software. You can never imagine the whole picture at first and all the things you run into. Therefore, get a piece of what you want to make tangible and see how much you already like it. Is it just a mock-up, is it a running prototype you can show of to your friends and family or is it something you already want to share with the world.
Eventually we came together, prioritized, developed and launched some cool apps. It’s not about doing it perfect the first time right, but it’s about being inspired and getting the feeling of joy when you show each other what you created.
What we do is software development and consultancy. Whether it is to get you started by taking your own first steps in getting your company going, or trying to make breakthroughs in your corporate environment, we can help you! We created our own world which is Brevis Studios, and we would like you to get involved.

Northern Wonder,https://www.eu-startups.com/directory/northern-wonder/,Netherlands,"Northern Wonder focuses on producing coffee from non-tropical components in order to have a positive impact on the environment. As the global demand for coffee increases, so do coffee plantations — destroying rainforests at a critical rate. Recent research from WWF ranks coffee as number 6 on the list of leading causes of deforestation. Incollaboration with the University of Amsterdam, we’re currently getting to the bottom of this; investigating the deeper consequences of increasing coffee production. The first results are alarming. We enjoy our daily shot of energy at the expense of our planet’s biodiversity.
Over the years, we’ve seen beautiful initiatives such as the stimulation of organic plantations or increasing the coffee yield per hectare. However, the reality is that in order to really combat deforestation, these evolutions are not enough.

As food technologists succeed to make meat without animals, we asked ourselves: can we make coffee without beans? What if we could make our favourite elixir from local ingredients?

Coffee is a unique gift of nature. Whether you adore your filter coffee at home, prefer a barista’s cappuccino or an Italian espresso at the bar — nothing should change about those delicious moments.

As true explorers, we’re on a quest to research all components in all edible non-tropical plants. From our lab at the World Food Center, we work in close collaboration with Wageningen University & Research and our leading food technology partners to find answers to our big question: what molecules are promising building blocks to mimic that signature coffee flavour?

In the coming years, we’ll pour ourselves into developing a delicious cup of coffee, indistinguishable from what you’re currently enjoying.",,Ede,"coffee, beverage, alternative, sustainable",Between €500K-€ 1 million,2021,https://northern-wonder.com,,NL,

The first time you taste Kumasi you may think ""Hmm, strangely fruity!'' Naturally, we associate cocoa with a fine, chocolaty taste, but there is way more to cocoa than just that. That's why we were surprised that this delicious juice normally goes to waste. During the harvest of the cocoa beans this delicious juice flows into the earth, just like that. And that's a waste. Both for the farmers as for us, cocoa lovers.  100% Natural, 0% Waste   If you want to make chocolate, it's just the beans that you're after. But for Kumasi, we are mainly interested in a residual product, the fruit pulp. In our cocoa juice we found a 100% natural solution, made from the fruit surrounding the cocoa beans. In this way, we prevent the waste of an exclusive and delicious product, and are able to offer farmers in Ghana an extra source of income (up to 30% increase). Next to that, our product will be 100% Ghanaian, as we are producing our cocoa juice from bean to bottle in the Kumasi region (Ghana).  Strangely Fruity  Extracting juice from the pulp of the cocoa fruit sounds like a cool idea, but is it also tasty? For a documentary for Nestlé, Lars Gierveld traveled to Ghana to learn more about the cocoa supply chain, and during this quest he was offered some juice for the first time. He was overwhelmed by the fruity taste of the juice: ""The taste is something that you have never experienced before! Because our association with cacao is so strongly linked to chocolate, our brain expects a chocolate taste"". But that's not what it tastes like at all! Cocoa is a fruit, and therefore the pulp has a fruity, sweet and invigorating flavor (think apple-lychee!).",,Amsterdam,"drinks, beverage, natural",No funding announced yet,2021,kumasi-drinks.nl/,,NL,

Year of 1000km is a B2C SaaS application which allows users to record their progress in any health-related activities; both physical and cognitive. It then converts that progress into a single value which can be benchmarked against others in custom or pre-set fitness challenges.
We began our journey back in 2018 when the Year of 1000km Founder, Lee Haines, started a competition with a group of remote friends to run 1000km within the calendar year. It was a way to stay in touch with old friends, and even make a few new ones.  Google Sheets was their weapon of choice to record and visualize their progress.
A few months into the year, Lee suffered an injury and was no longer able to run.
A New Problem Emerged
Running was no longer an option for Lee, but the doctor said he could do other activities, such as cycling.
However, there was no way for him to continue taking part in the challenge because there was no way to directly compare his cycling activity with the running progress of his friends.
But he found a way, and Year of 1000km was born.
How Does Year of 1000km Solve the Problem?
Our web application allows users to record progress in ANY health-related activity and converts it into a single value which is then displayed on graphs.
This allows for an apples-to-apples comparison against others, regardless of what fitness (physical or mental) activities they are taking part in.
We have “Official Challenges” which anyone can join to compete against others in the global Year of 1000km community; they are:
•	Distance Challenge
•	Healthy Lifestyle Challenge
•	Healthy Mind Challenge
More details on each of these challenges can be found on the Year of 1000km website, yearof1000km.com.
Users can also create and invite others to their own fitness challenges with custom goals, dates and activities.
Custom Challenges offer a fantastic opportunity for people to connect with friends or work colleagues, and for fitness trainers to keep their clients on track and create a fun, healthy environment to challenge each other.
About Year of 1000km
Year of 1000km, founded in 2018, is not only an application, it’s a global community of people that believe in motivating each other and making their health and wellness a priority in their daily lives.

Our pipeline allows us to analyze a vast amount of genetic data, enabling estimations of the number of individuals affected by many rare diseases and to identify the specific genetic mutations they carry, independent of diagnosis. This information is invaluable for understanding disease burden, assessing market opportunities, to prepare and inform opportunities and challenges for drug development, investment and commercialization strategies.
Patient Selection and Beyond
GeneScape plays a pivotal role in streamlining identifying the right patient for the right drug in clinical trials. Our advanced genomic analysis capabilities allow researchers and clinicians to identify individuals who are most likely to benefit from specific investigational treatments. By selecting patients with specific genetic profiles, clinical trials can be optimized, leading to more efficient and effective drug development processes.  In parallel, our patient modelling leverages data from diverse genetic ancestries, reflecting the diversity of target markets, supporting representation for diversity and inclusion in clinical trials.  
Investment and Forecasting
Furthermore, GeneScape offers market forecasting services to guide investment decisions and commercialization strategies in the field drug development for rare and orphan diseases. By leveraging our comprehensive genetic data analysis to inform the total addressable population and deep-market insights, we provide valuable forecasts and projections for specific genetic therapies and their potential market impact.

Dayrize,https://www.eu-startups.com/directory/dayrize/,Netherlands,"Dayrize offers  a new approach to sustainable shopping online, making it easy and enjoyable to buy goods that do good. Everyone can make a little bit of difference with every purchase – and that all adds up to a huge change for the better.

The technology is complex and ground-breaking, but the output is simple: a single, meaningful figure we call The Dayrize Score. Every product gets its own unique score, which means for the first time ever we can all accurately compare the impact of products.","Problem identification: Shopping for sustainable products is a time-consuming and confusing experience for consumers. The market is currently in a status quo where there is very little transparency about the actual impact of the products being sold on the market. This status quo stems from the state-of-the-art system for assessing the environmental impact of products, which is time-consuming, expensive and inaccurate due to a lack of available data. 
The solution to the problem: Dayrize.com will bring the fragmented market of sustainable products into one platform and act as a trusted source for consumers to compare the sustainability performance of individual products. In order to realize this ambition, a proprietary A.I. powered vetting tool, called Lucy, will assess the sustainability impact of a broad range of consumer products (from food to household electronics) in a rapid, robust, and automated way. The assessment will be summarized in a Dayrize Score, which will be standardized for all products, making it easy to really compare the sustainability of products across ranges and categories on the e-commerce platform. 
Product in focus: Lucy is the core differentiating feature of the Dayrize.com e-commerce marketplace and the focus of this project. The main challenge is to develop a multi-faceted tool with several interoperable components that are able to perform scientifically sound life-cycle analysis within a short period of time and a high accuracy. The technical success relies on a combination of innovative approaches in both environmental impact methodologies as well as software development and Artificial Intelligence.",Amsterdam,"circular economy, sustainable, e-commerce, AI",Between €2.5 million-5 million,2020,https://dayrize.com,,NL,

The AAARRR principle is a growth hacking tool. It is used to grow a company quickly by solving the problems in the flow one by one. 

AAARRR stands for Awareness, Acquisition, Activation, Retention, Revenue and Referral. Our marketing is definitely not a Pay-per-click way, but rather based on automated conversations, just as you would. We focus on the AAARRR sequence. First we ask for a connection (Awareness), then we let you know what we have to offer (Acquisition), if you are interested, we refer to the product or service (Activation). When the product or service has been delivered, we tempt the customer to return (Retention). If follow-up purchases are made, you create recurring revenue (Revenue). With good service, your customer will become an ambassador and refer others to your product or service (Referral). Only then is the AAARRR 100% effective!

We can almost completely automate the AAARRR process for you so that you can focus on your business operations. We use various online software packages for this, which run entirely in the cloud.  

For almost every type of company we look for the most suitable solution to fully automate your specific AAARRR marketing processes. We have also derived our company name from this; Quest = search.

Do you also want your customers on a silver platter? Then call 06-50218580!

A few days in nature without a device, pen and paper. Only with water and yourself. I did it a few years ago and realized how beautiful nature is. And how everything that lives is connected. Why do we distinguish between animals? Why do we like pets and are there other animals that we only see as consumption?
The way we currently keep animals for consumption is exhausting the earth. By eating animal-free, 75% of agriculture could be returned to nature. That is an area the size of the US, China, EU and Australia combined.
To make a difference, I started Natulatte. The idea arose when I was once again drinking coffee at the office, and realized that the coffee corner is not only boring, but also not animal-free. Time for more inspiration!

We created a platform to care for those most in need. 85 year old ladies (and men) with heart failure.
It is a group depending on intensive health care their remaining part of their lives. More often than not, their doctors visits are too early (like a pre-scheduled visit) or late (and visit our ER, or get hospitalised. 
Not only do we provide a non-intrusive platform for censoring, we too provide repetitive questioning with a patented method, designed to provide Big Data  and deliver information a professional or family member needs.We see these 3 groups as our market, and simultaneously adding insights for parties involved by user interface and other research.","We want to reduce the burden of care for those in need the most.
In the Netherlands roughly a third of heart failure costs (380 million yearly) is spend on over- 80 year old ladies (yearly approximately 22.8 billion for western societies)s. This reflects the large need, not only financially, it reflects the burden of disease. From a large personnel cardiology experience, more often than not patients come in late, with worrisome fluid overload in the legs, or incapacitating congestion of the lungs.
In over half of patients, subtle signs were missed that could have warranted action. Non cardiac hospitalisations play another important role. Quite the opposite however, is what we encounter at our out patient clinics. For example, regular appointments to check adherence to therapy and find signs of deterioration are cumbersome to patients and it might not be worth the hassle for some (up to 30%).
Home monitoring in these groups has rarely been tested, tests have demonstrated negative, or were performed in much younger (male) patients. We benefit by having a large senior network and as a senior cardiologist, dr Ronner alone has an experience of over 20.000 patient-contacts that inspired this endeavour.
A prototype is being tested, sensor tech is combined in this platform, to deliver data to family or health care workers to act if needed, to refrain from action when signs allow.
We cooperate with established academic partners and a large teaching hospital.
We provide a method and solution to save time, enhance health and reduce cost.
We aim at a selling price and a yearly contribution.
An investor can get help to deliver the predefined steps for licensing and CE mark and scale up there after.

Imagjn,https://www.eu-startups.com/directory/imagjn/,Netherlands,"The academic publishing world is outdated, bureaucratic, slow and unfair. Academics spend years writing academic papers, reviewers and editors spend days reviewing, but once an article is published, none of those involved receives a financial reward. Copyright must be transferred while the publisher offers the paper for sale. Although there is open access today, universities have to pay large sums to the publishers to make this possible, while universities have already spent a lot of money to make the research and the article possible in the first place.
 
In addition, the scientific method (in particular the process of blind peer reviews) is slow, bureaucratic, not traceable and is filled with nepotism. Finally, outdated citation software makes it impossible for academics to collaborate efficiently. It is time for a change.
 
With Imagjn we have solutions for the above problems:
 1. An improved and accelerated publication and blind peer review process, from 6-9 months to weeks, resulting in more published papers for universities,
 2. Easily collaborate on academic papers through an integrated cloud-based citation/editing package;
 3. Migrating from a Journal Impact Factor to an Individual Impact Factor (IIF), where control and ownership lie with the academics and universities and not with the publishers. An IIF makes valorisation easier for universities,
 4. Research that has been done with public money must be publicly available. Imagjn makes academic research publicly available and universities will eventually save millions per year on commercial academic licenses,
 5. Direct (financial) remuneration of all those involved in writing academic papers.

The business model consists of a monthly fee to be paid for by universities. There are over 11.000 universities around the world who would pay between 1500-3500 euro per month (depending on the number of students and staff).",,The Hague,"academic publishing, academic papers",No funding announced yet,2018,https://imagjn.com,,NL,

IKUU is de ingenieuze uitwerking van iets dat begon met één simpele gedachte. Een filosofie. Een overtuiging dat het analyseren van data toegankelijk moet zijn voor iedereen.
Al jouw data verzameld

Die filosofie leidde tot de geboorte van IKUU: een ongecompliceerd platform dat data gedetailleerder weergeeft dan ooit. Het systeem vergaart alle (ruwe) data in één grote ‘verzamelbak’: het Customer Data Platform (CDP). Gegevens die afkomstig zijn van bijvoorbeeld Direct Mail, CRM of sociale media verrijkt IKUU met extra informatie, bijvoorbeeld KvK-nummers. Zo krijg je een compleet beeld van je marketingdata. En hoeveel data je ook koppelt, de data-analyse blijft van het hoogste niveau. Daarnaast maakt IKUU ál je data inzichtelijk, niet alleen het topje van de ijsberg. IKUU laat zo niet alleen de hoeveelheid leads zien die een marketingcampagne heeft gecreëerd, maar ook hoe deze lead is binnen gekomen, welke route hij heeft afgelegd en welke rol je marketing en sales hierin speelt.

Zoveel inzicht, dat het confronterend is

Welke bijdrage heeft je marketingcampagne op de behaalde omzet? In hoeverre is je salesafdeling effectief in het vinden van nieuwe kansen in de markt? IKUU geeft rechtstreeks inzicht in deze data, zodat je toekomstige marketingcampagnes effectiever en efficiënter worden. Voor elke lead onderscheidt IKUU twee bronnen: Marketing Intelligence (MI) en Sales Module (SM). Door middel van het systeem traceer je of de lead is binnengekomen via sales- of marketingactiviteiten. Een stimulans voor de afdelingen om slimmer samen te werken. Dus wees gewaarschuwd: IKUU biedt zoveel inzicht, dat het al snel confronterend is. Ook onderscheidt IKUU Sales Sourced, Marketing Generated of Marketing Influenced leads.

    Wanneer een klant tijdens het salesproces interacties heeft met de marketinguiting is de lead ‘Marketing 
    Influenced’.
    Sales Sourced verwijst naar klanten die direct voortkomen uit sales.

Marine Performance Systems,https://www.eu-startups.com/directory/marine-performance-systems-b-v/,Netherlands,"Our vision is to provide integrated solutions that significantly reduce the Shipping Industry’s operating costs and environmental footprint.
Marine Performance Systems B.V (MPS) has developed a breakthrough technology: an advanced fluidic air lubrication system (MPS FAL) that reduces the fuel consumption of existing ships by up to 20% with a 2-3 years’ payback time. This yields significant savings in greenhouse gas emissions, as every ton of fuel saved avoids 3.2 tons of CO2 emission. To the shipowner, MPS FAL represents a 68% better business case over current air lubrication solutions during the total life cycle.
We want our fluidic air lubrication system to serve as a performance enhancement platform that collects critical vessel operating data for real-time performance optimisation.","Company description
MPS is a Danish-Dutch marine technology & engineering company, founded in 2018 by two SMEs combining their capabilities, based in the Port of Rotterdam, Netherlands, with an office in Copenhagen, Denmark. The founders have more than 130 years of collective experience taking innovative technologies to market from A.P. Moller-Maersk, Shell, IBM, and Royal IHC as well as successful entrepreneurs within Maritime.
Technology description
Our innovation is an advanced Fluidic Air Lubrication technology designated MPS FAL. It uses our proprietary “Fluidic Technology”, which is patent protected worldwide.
MPS FAL consists of multiple 800x55mm wing shaped bands fitted to the bottom of a ship. These bands feed arrays of fluidic oscillators that inject large volumes of air, in the form of sized bubbles, into the water boundary layer. This creates a bubble ’carpet’ of up 80 million air bubbles / second that reduce viscous drag by up to 70%, or a 15-20% gross reduction in fuel consumption and associated emissions.
We have submitted three patent applications Q1 2020 to further expand the IP portfolio for second and third generations of MPS FAL..
Competitive advantages
Air lubrication (AL) was introduced to the Shipping Industry 5-6 years ago, but the market uptake did not happen as first generation AL systems did not meet market expectations in terms of net savings, operating stability, and business case. Key direct competitor is the Silverstream System that yields 5-8% savings.
MPS FAL presents a completely new and innovative approach to generate air bubbles and to ensure stable performance compared to existing AL systems:
- the fluidic technology offers higher, more sustained drag reduction levels at lower injection rates. See video of the air layer: https://bit.ly/2Rq271z
- superior stability and control under varying operating conditions and sea states
- installation within scheduled time frame and in parallel to dry-docking activities, and does not affect the - watertight integrity of the ship thus does not require costly vessel recertification
- fuel savings of up to 20% with double-digit reductions in CO2, NOX, and SOX
- retrofittable to 65% of existing merchant fleet with a 2-3 years’ payback period
Our technology has been awarded the EU Seal of Excellence, won 1st prize in EU BlueInvest 2020, 1st prize in the Offshore Wind Innovation Challenge, and is shortlisted as a finalist in the Seatrade Maritime Asia Award. We are members of the World Alliance for Efficient Solutions.
