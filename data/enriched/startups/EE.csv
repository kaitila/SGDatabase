2.	Yield Generation: In addition to standard royalty payments, creators can participate in the platform's yield pool, where a portion of the transaction fees is distributed proportionally based on the popularity and engagement of their content. This provides an additional revenue stream and enhances the overall economic value of their music assets.
3.	Staking for Enhanced Yields: Creators can further boost their revenue by staking their copyrights within the NIM ecosystem for a predetermined duration. This allows them to earn additional dividends reflective of the collective growth of the staked content, offering an even greater return on their creative works.
4.

6.	Direct Monetization Opportunities: By utilizing the NIM technology and the legal frameworks provided, creators can enjoy transparent royalty payments and direct monetization opportunities, eliminating the need for intermediaries and ensuring fair compensation for their work.

The Fair Music project (co-funded by EU)
The Fair Music Project represents a significant evolution in the music industry, focusing on transparency, fair remuneration, and equitable treatment for all stakeholders, particularly artists and songwriters. By leveraging blockchain technology and establishing a decentralized platform, the Fair Music Project aims to tackle the long-standing issues of opaque payment structures and the inefficient distribution of revenues within the music industry.
For Fans in Subscription Services
Fans stand to gain significantly from the Fair Music Project through enhanced transparency and a direct connection to the artists they love. Utilizing blockchain technology ensures that fans can directly contribute to the financial well-being of their favorite artists. This direct fan-to-artist payment mechanism, exemplified by platforms like Internet Music Fans, empowers fans to support artists more effectively than traditional streaming services, where a significant portion of the revenue is absorbed by intermediaries before reaching the artists.
For Artists and Songwriters
Artists and songwriters are at the core of the Fair Music Project's mission. The initiative promises several transformative benefits:
•	Equitable Compensation: Artists and songwriters have long been disadvantaged when receiving fair compensation for their work. The Fair Music Project's approach ensures that every play or stream directly contributes to the artist's income, challenging the current model where a substantial portion of revenue is lost to various intermediaries.
•	Transparency in Payments: One of the most critical aspects of the Fair Music Project is using blockchain technology to create a transparent and immutable record of song origins, plays, and payments. This level of transparency enables artists and songwriters to see precisely how their work is being used and compensated, addressing the current issue of opaque and delayed reporting from streaming platforms and record labels.
•	Direct Engagement with Fans: By reducing the reliance on intermediaries and allowing for direct payments from fans, artists can cultivate a closer relationship with their audience. This direct engagement benefits artists financially and fosters a stronger artist-fan community.
•	Global Reach and Cultural Sharing: The decentralized nature of the Fair Music Project facilitates the global dissemination of music, allowing artists to reach audiences worldwide without the constraints of traditional music distribution channels. This global reach also promotes cultural exchange and diversity in music.
•	Sustainability and Long-Term Viability: By ensuring fair compensation and recognition, artists and songwriters can sustain their creativity and livelihood. The Fair Music Project aims to create an environment where artists can thrive and continue to produce music without financial strain.
The Fair Music Project is a pioneering initiative striving to reshape the music industry into a more transparent, fair, and artist-centric ecosystem. Its success could pave the way for a new era in music, where artists and songwriters are adequately compensated for their creativity and contributions, and fans can more directly support the music they love.
Highlighting a significant project as an example:
Africa and the Fair Music Project
Leveraging NIM Technology for the Digital Economy
With the NIM technology platform at its core, the Fair Music Project is poised to revolutionize the digital economy across Africa, a continent currently experiencing the fastest digital economic growth worldwide.
Drawing on insights from McKinsey's ""The Future of Payments in Africa"" report, it's evident that Africa's digital payments market is expected to surge by 152% from 2020 to 2025, achieving nearly $40 billion in revenue from domestic payments alone. Although impressive, this growth only scratches the surface, as digital transactions constitute a mere 5-7% of Africa's total transaction volume.
One of the most innovative aspects of the NIM platform's integration into Africa's burgeoning digital economy is the introduction of CREATIVES, a stablecoin unique for its intrinsic value. CREATIVES provides a viable subscription alternative to fiat currency, specifically designed to facilitate trans-country transactions, a notable challenge in Africa.
By employing NIM tokens as a foundational currency across the continent, coupled with the stability offered by CREATIVES, the platform ensures instant transfers, minimizing foreign exchange risks and loss from compound interest. It's crucial to highlight that ROYs maintain a 1:1 parity with the equivalent amount held in escrow, ensuring consistency and reliability in value.
The Fair Music Project, through the NIM platform, extends its influence beyond simplifying transactions to empowering unbanked individuals across Africa.
By merely requiring an email, subscribers and creators can engage in a direct fan-to-artist scenario, benefiting from the digital economy's growth without the traditional barriers of financial systems.
This approach democratizes digital economy access for creators and fans alike. It accelerates money movement, ensuring artists receive their dues swiftly and securely.
NIM's capability to offer seamless royalty and fiat transfers directly to bank accounts marks a significant milestone. This development eradicates the cumbersome financial hurdles that have historically impeded the flow of funds within the creative sector. The NIM platform embodies the principle of ""More money, faster"" for Africa's digital economy, paving the way for a future where digital transactions are inclusive, efficient, and reflective of the continent's dynamic growth potential.
NIM Virtual Wallet and email account
You only need an email account to use the NIM Virtual Wallet service and payment solutions. Worldwide, there are 4.26 billion email accounts.
While specific data on email account penetration across Africa are scarce. Considering Africa's population of approximately 1.37 billion people (as of 2021), and assuming that around 20% of the population has an email, we estimate that there are roughly 274 million email accounts in Africa.
The rapid growth of mobile internet connectivity and the increasing adoption of smartphones in Africa suggest that email usage will likely expand in the coming years. As more Africans come online, the potential for email-based financial services and communications will grow, presenting opportunities for providers to reach a more extensive customer base.
NIM can offer accessible, affordable, and user-friendly mobile payment solutions via a simple email account and login without knowing what's beneath the surface.
NIM will be well-positioned to serve the needs of Africa's unbanked and underbanked populations.

The second party on the e-marketplace are the vendors. Their general route to market is either through an own sales force, through a distribution network or agents.

Originally, we planned to name the software ‘Woodstock’ (as a big portion of our clientele dealt with stocking wood products), but as the word associated with the 1960s music festival, rather than a tool for scheduling wood-related processes, we decided to go with Woodware.
Woodware Systems' success only fuelled our enthusiasm, so we began working on another project. However, this time we decided not to focus solely on the woodworking industry, but provide a simple and affordable scheduling tool for anyone with the need to manage resources. As a result, Yutiti was born in 2008.
As Yutiti was greeted with open arms and our clients' feedback was positive, we decided to take yet another step, so in July 2010, we launched Ganttic - a simplified web-based resource allocation software. One might even say that Ganttic’s just a more advanced version of Yutiti.
Since we started working together in 2002, we have developed a lot - the systems, our tools and ourselves! And we haven't stopped yet!
In August 2020 we celebrate our 10th birthday of providing the most flexible resource management solution to our clients around the world.",,

EcoPetBox,https://www.eu-startups.com/directory/ecopetbox/,Estonia,EcoPetBox uses recycled materials to create products for the pet industry that would be plastic and chemical free and ultimately contribute to cleaner environment.,Tallinn,"Innovative, Sustainable, Nature-friendly, User-friendly.",Between €500K-€ 1 million,2019,www.ecopetbox.com,EE,"EcoPetBox is an inspiring company who manufactures biodegradable pet products that are made from 100% recycled materials. The main products are biodegradable litter tray, food/drink bowl and biodegradable litter that have all been made using recycled 100% natural ingredients.
The company was founded in 2019 by Priit and Jorgen who after the product launch started to look for different distributors, mainly through special fairs and expeditions. Even though their idea of a biodegradable litter box that would replace the good old plastic tray was first laughed at, they stubbornly continued their journey and quickly rose to be the new cool product on the market. It was at the Global Pet Expo in Orlando, in 2020 that EcoPetBox found its biggest distributor and now there is a steady flow of EcoPetBox products into the USA.
The most popular so far has been the biodegradable litter box which is made using a special pressing technique and for materials only water, cardboard and/or paper are used. Since EcoPetBox is made of 100% natural ingredients it is safer for the pet as well as the pet owner - there is no need to come into contact with urine and faeces as there is no need to wash the litter box. Washing the litter box (were it made of plastic) is in itself a pretty harmful project as the process includes wasting freshwater and contamination via the chemicals that can leak into the estuaries as the byproduct of the whole washing process.
Therefore, EcoPetBox products are not only good for the end user but for our precious ecosystems as well.
The company started seeking funding in May of 2021 via different platforms and pitching events. Pretty soon the company attracted a few different groups of investors who began lengthy conversation with the founders to establish a possible way for future collaboration. It took many months of hard work as the investors had a lot of questions and they also pushed the company to come up with attractive numbers and concrete plans that would be convincing enough for a wider group of investors. By February 2021 it was clear that the round would be closed soon, but the actual closing date was at the end of April 2021 due to negotiations that lasted longer than anticipated and due to new investors showing interest to join in.
EcoPetBox is now implementing all the plans and goals set out in the business proposal and is hoping to acquire even a bigger chunk of the massive pet market.",,

Stargate RTK — GNSS correction signal provider for precise cm-level positioning of outdoor autonomous robots, drones, and IoT applications.",Tallinn,"GNSS, robots, positioning, navigation",Between €1-€100K,2018,https://prns.io,EE,"There is a growing trend of the emergence and increasing usage of innovative GNSS OEM solutions for mass applications with RTK functionality:
* U-blox: ZED-F9P;
* Quectel: L26-P;
* Septentrio: mosaic-X5;
* SkyTraq: PX1122R;
* and others.
Due to the low price, small size and lightweight, GNSS modules based on these solutions became a vital part of mass-market autonomous applications: outdoor robots, drones, autonomous vehicles and even IoT applications.
To achieve cm-level positioning accuracy, the applications mentioned above rely on GNSS correction services. There are many GNSS correction services available; however, they were not designed to serve mass applications:
1-they are difficult to access
2-they lack compatibility, as they all have different connection credentials, correction types, data formats
3-they are difficult to integrate as they can't provide you with a correction stream with specific requirements for your project.
4-they have limited coverage
5-their pricing models aren't attractive for large fleet operators.
So, although the ground infrastructure is there, it's still hard to deploy and precisely track thousands of connected devices. 
Stargate RTK is bridging the gap between legacy GNSS correction providers and the modern needs of robotic and IoT applications.
Stargate RTK is a GNSS correction service for the precise positioning of robotics, drones and IoT applications. Stargate RTK utilises existing GNSS infrastructure owned by different GNSS correction providers (public and commercial) and provides value-added services that help robotic/drone manufacturers and operators scale their fleets and remain budget-savvy.
Competitors like HxGN Smartnet, Trimble VRS or Topcon Live do have wide service coverage. However, they are still stuck with old business models as their main customers were always humans: surveyors, farmers, machine operators, and not growing autonomous fleets. Thus, they have all the problems mentioned above.
And modern PPP-RTK providers have limited compatibility with GNSS/INS modules that are already on the market. Their lock-in business models also aren't attractive.
Stargate RTK utilises existing public infrastructure and adopts and enhances its GNSS data for future autonomous and green applications like delivery, street cleaning, snow-shovelling and trash-collecting. That increases economic efficiency and helps save resources. From that standpoint, Stargate RTK solves one of the SDG — building resilient infrastructure.",,

We all have belongings in our lives that we treasure, that we want to keep in good condition for as long as possible. However, life can take its toll, meaning these items can start to look tired, dirty and past their best.
What if we told you there was a way you could make sure your shoes, your handbags, your favourite dress or even your car or TV could be protected against everyday life? The answer comes in the form of Nanotechnology.
THE ULTIMATE PROTECTION FOR PRECIOUS ITEMS
Here at GoGoNano we have developed a range of products that utilise the power of Nanotechnology. They are designed to work with a variety of precious, prized and expensive products that you may have in your life including vehicles, electronics and textiles. After all, everyone has their special items that they’d never want to give up, be it a pair of shoes or a laptop.
Our sprays ensure those items are kept looking beautiful and pristine, no matter how much or how often you use them.
A helping hand to the environment
One of the main goals of the entire team at GoGoNano is to deliver a helping hand to the environment. After all, protecting the world around us is something we should all be trying harder to do. Our innovative brand does this in a few different ways.
Firstly, it tackles the issues created by a throwaway culture. All too often in these modern times, we choose cheaper, low-cost items which we use for a short period of time before throwing them away. This means overproduction, heedless pollution and very soon, a huge impact on the environment.
By enabling you to protect items you have bought and keep them in good condition, we help you to keep them for longer, rather than throwing them away.
Our superhydrophobic coatings are also developed to be kind to the environment directly, too – something that we are incredibly proud of here at GoGoNano. We never use harmful ingredients in our products.
Furthermore, by using our products you can reduce the time spent cleaning by as much as 80%. This means you will save yourself time and will also need to use less and less of the harmful cleaning chemicals and products you may have in your cleaning cupboard.
Why GoGoNano?
So, why use GoGoNano? Here are some of the reasons why we think our products might be the ideal choice for your everyday life. From electronics to clothes and cars, you can use our products on practically anything. They are incredibly easy to use and come complete with full instructions to ensure you get it right. Our products combine state-of-the-art nanotechnology and environmentally friendly ingredients, which provides the perfect combination for you and for the world around you.
