SPEENRGY,https://www.eu-startups.com/directory/speenrgy/,Latvia,"Startup SPEENRGY is Developing a Unique Device, a Range Extender for All Types of EVs, Drones, E-Bikes, Cars, Cargo, Buses, Trucks, eVTOLs and Airplanes.

Technology Approved by EPO as Innovative and It has already received the Publication of European and World Patent, and will continue to receive Unitary Patent in Europe  as well as Patents in Key Countries Around the World.

It is an Innovative Green Electricity Generator which has a Modular Design and Can be Easily Adapted for Any Type of Vehicle.
Device Generates Green Electricity During Transportation, which is Used to Power Systems or to Charge the Battery. 

Generation Possibilities from 2 kW per hour to 20-30 kW per hour.
This Device Represents a New Opportunity to Unlock the Full Potential for Electric Transport in All Areas and Accelerate the Transition to Zero Emissions in the Transport Sector.","The Device Uses  Kinetic Energy of the Rushing Air Flow and Converts it into Clean Electricity, which can be used in the Moment for Power Systems or for Charging Batteries Directly in Motion.
Similar Technology is used in Raw Air Turbine to Generate Electricity in Emergency Situations.
Technology Approved by EPO as Innovative and We have already received the Publication of European and World Patent, and will continue to receive Unitary Patent in Europe  as well as Patents in Key Countries Around the World.
The Possibility of Generating Electricity with Micro Turbines installed on vehicles has been confirmed several times.
But since in those tests ordinary generators and standard blades were used, the potential of such turbines was only superficially investigated.
In the Design of Device We used a New Type of Generator that has a High Efficiency and is as simple as possible to use, a Type of Blades that will allow a Large Flow of Kinetic Energy of the air stream and with minimal losses to Transmit Torque to the Generator.
We believe, this is a Significant Breakthrough for Electric Transportation, which requires Attention and Development.
The General Feature of my device is Modularity, the Ability to Adapt its size to many Types of EV transportation, from Drones and Bicycles to Cars, Trains, eVTOL and Airplanes.
By changing the size of the main components and the size of the outer casing of the device, changing the amount of energy generated, which is also important when used with vehicles that consume 15 kW per hour or more of electricity.
A detailed product range
Technology is based on basic modules which are the basis of the device. The basic modules can be of different sizes, which allows me to adapt the size of the device to a specific type of transport.
This gives me the opportunity to use the technology with a very wide range of electric vehicles.
The minimum size of the device is capable of producing 1-2 to 4-5 kWh of electricity. This is enough to be used with small drones of about 1 meter or more in size, as well as with electric bicycles and scooters.
The middle size device is capable of producing between 5-7 kWh and 10-15 kWh of electricity. It depends on the type of generator and the size of the device. This size is convenient to use with medium and large size drones, as well as with city electric bikes and cars.
The large size device is capable of producing 15-17 kWh to 25-30 kWh of electricity. As I said before, it depends on the type of generator and the size of the device. This size device is suitable for cars, buses and trucks. Also for EVTOL and small airplanes.
It is possible to produce another size of device to generate from 30 kWh to 50 kWh of electricity. This type of device could be used in aviation to create hybrid airplanes or all-electric airplanes.
At the moment, aviation is using similar technology, but it is already outdated and is only used in emergencies as it generates no more than 5 kW of electricity.

LendSecured,https://www.eu-startups.com/directory/lendsecured/,Latvia,LendSecured is crowdfunding platform focused on agricultural loans with low LTV.,"LendSecured is crowdfunding platform focused on financing the agricultural sector.
For the last 10 years, we have built successfully licensed lending and debt collection companies from zero. Our team have had several large renovation objects finished, made over 800 real estate deals, lent over €30 million.
The core pillar and philosophy for us is to minimize the risks. To minimize the risks, we publish investment projects with low LTV (Loan-to-Value ratio). Our mission is to offer investors all across Europe asset-backed agricultural and development projects with high returns, allowing anyone to reach their financial goals. For this purpose we carefully evaluate every application and publish investment projects only with low LTV, striving to ensure the lowest possible risk.
By ensuring that investors earn high returns and borrowers can strive to reach their business goals, LendSecured's objectives are to solve the lack of funds in the European agricultural sector, boost economic growth and bring additional value to published projects. LendSecured thinks green and hopes to attract investors who want to invest in ways that benefit society, i.e. those that support small farmers, environmentally safe farming practices and crop production.
The economic accounts for agriculture show that total agricultural output in the European Union (EU) stood at €418.0 billion in basic prices in 2019. But in 9 out of 28 EU countries, farmers experience hard times accessing funding. The potential volume of funding needed is from €8 to €15 billion for those 9 countries.
LendSecured believe that crowdlending can solve such financial gaps.
As a solution for this problem, we have created a crowdlending platform that connects farmers with investors. Investors can fund different risk level projects. Moreover, all projects are collateral back with additional private guarantees from the farmer. For the seasonal funding loans (grain financing), there is an additional 3-way agreement between grain buyers, LendSecured, and the farmer.
Furthermore, we provide a unique scoring system for investors. This system is based on historical harvest volumes, an increase of harvest volume (by obtaining new land), and an analysis of the financial situation based on account statements and internal farm records.
Our main motivation is to help not only to make a profit for investors but also to support small farmers, environmentally safe farming practices, and crop production. Investors help the economy and make a social impact, by making a profit. In its turn, farmers get access to the funding.",Riga,"crowdfunding, investments, agritech",No funding announced yet,2020,www.lendsecured.eu,,LV,

PurOceans Technologyâ¢,https://www.eu-startups.com/directory/puroceans-technology/,Latvia,"PurOceans Technology™ is a Latvian startup within the CleanTech industry, established in 2019. Founded by a team of 5 members, with 35 years of combined experience. 
Our mission is to clean up seabeds from oil products and microplastic around the world. Concretely, our technology aims to rehabilitate deep waters and restore/recover dead zones, which currently include over 500 areas around the globe. 
Our unique-patented technology is able to remove plastic and oil products from SEA FLOOR by means of only AIR bubbles, with 99% of success. Besides, it's not only a totally safe way to remove pollution, but also a method that speeds up the rehabilitation of the water body ecosystem. Indeed, we solve the environmental issue by removing 98-99% of the bottom pollution for 70 000 euros/ha; while we take care of utilization of the pollution for 30 000 euros/ha, without interrupting Business as Usual and cleaning 1 ha/per 2-4 weeks.","As aforementioned, PurOceans Technology™ aims to remove pollutants such as oil sediments and microplastics from the water bodies' seabed without harming the environment and avoiding any chemical treatment or process of excavation; just by using air bubbles and pressure, while complying with regulations and SDG 13-14. Precisely, our technology brings a non-invasive, eco and budget-friendly, sustainable, and efficient service (us vs current solutions). Our methods are respectful and eco-friendly, as one of our goals is beside the clean-up of the seafloor, its active rehabilitation by improving both the environment and the flora and fauna.
Aiming to explain in a nutshell our proprietary technology, it must be pointed out that it is based on the action of pumping ambient air in the form of bubbles to the lowest depths of the water body, where they naturally adhere to any chemical pollutants in the environment. Once the chemicals lock-in, the force of buoyancy (in direct opposition to gravity) pulls the pollution up to the surface. From there, we collect, process, and transform toxic waste into purified water, filtering the pollution out with special tanks.
Our unique-patented technology within the CleanTech industry focuses on bottom cleaning, while other companies clean up the surface clean-up, hence enriching partnerships can be derivate from their combination. Besides, PurOceans Technology™ is not only a safe way to remove pollution but also a method that speeds up the rehabilitation of the water body ecosystem, and which has been tested showing up a 99% of successful results.
Not only PurOceans Technology™ differentiate itself from the global market by its technology, but also since provides the most cost-efficient solution and the lowest cost of utilization in the current market. The successful pilot results show up a 98-99% efficiency thanks to our technology. And our market size agrees with USD 177.63 billion by 2025 regarding ¡ng the Global Oil Spill Management Market, with an increase of 77% in 10 years and the target focused on gain 42 million euros by 2028, ergo 0.025% of the oil spill market. While concerning the Active Ports in the world, our target is in 835 with a license to 5% of Ports, ergo 42 ports by 2030.
Precisely, our Business Model is divided into two stages, primarily. On one hand, in the first stage which is planned to take place between 2022 and 2023, we use a B2B/B2G Service provider charging per hectare cleaned, meaning €70 000 euros per HA. On the other hand, the second stage focuses on licensing the technology and charging per hectare cleaned, starting in 2024. Regarding the numbers per se, we propose €70 000 euros per HA for cleaning the polluted zone, together with €30 000 euros per HA as a lease/additional costs. Considering a more detailed and personalized Business Plan for each project, aligning with the needs and requirements of the customer. It must be pointed out that exists an extra obstacle referring to the pollution problem: the overflowing cost to solve this global affair, and the enormous complexity derivate from the methods that must be used to succeed.
Moreover, we provide results for the pollution problem by solving it while we promote a total circle of cleaning solutions, as we also aim to reduce the costs gradually once the seafloor starts to evidence sustainable improvements. We are based in Riga, ergo the Baltic Sea and the Atlantic Ocean, nevertheless, our technology can be applied worldwide. Indeed, we target a global network based on PurOceans Technology™ which cleans up the waters and seabeds around the globe. Hence, our main scope is the oil and gas companies, the municipalities, the waste management companies, and the environmental funds. Case in point, we have been reached out by numerous boards looking for a solution to the pollution problem, such as the Freeport of Riga or the Bulgarian municipality of Burgas.",Riga,"CleanTech, seabed, eco-friendly",Between €100K-€500K,2019,https://www.puroceans.com/,,LV,

Connected to the regular gas grid, HYGEN's fast refueling systems transform it into a distributed fueling network enabling gas companies to deliver clean and inexpensive (bio-) fuel to your doorsteps at a competitive price.
HYGEN's superchargers can fuel Gas Powered Vehicles anywhere in just a few minutes.
Hygen SIA introduces a ""HYGEN Plus"", an on-site refuelling appliance for natural gas vehicles. On-site refuelling with HYGEN Plus will “level playing field” for environ mentally friendly NGVs, in what is already common practice for households and businesses with electric vehicles. It will enable a future alternative fuel transport mode to flourish, where growth has been depressed due to a bottleneck in the number of public gas refuelling stations. Unlike large centralised public stations that require millions of euros to build, HYGEN+ is a cost-effective decentralised system, dedicated to the owner of the NGV. By offering convenient refuelling for the motorist, HYGEN Plus removes the bottleneck of a limited centralised refuelling network of stations.
We are the only company to base its refuelling system on liquid piston technology, a world’s first for CNG refuelling. The innovative nature of ""HYGEN Plus"" gives our solution a significant edge over the competition and provides the following unrivalled user benefits to NGV owners: 
•	Faster refuelling (7 mins – standard 80L tank) than competition and more convenient/practical than visiting public CNG filling station. 
•	35% fuel cost savings when using HYGEN Plus CNG versus diesel, 25% better than nearest competitor.
•	No upfront investment for end user (our business model allows gas companies to own, install and maintain HYGEN Plus), the user only pays for the fuel.
•	Low electrical consumption (0.45kWh/GLE ) and noise levels (65dB).
•	Allows end-user companies to “Green” their fleet of vehicles, moving to g-Mobility without compromising on cost and vehicle range. 
HYGEN Plus also enables our customers, the gas companies, to offer their customers’ CNG at a competitive price compared to diesel/petrol and the unique customer experience of fast at the office/home refuelling. Our range of unique customer benefits are summarised overleaf.
•	Viable means to increase biomethane and syngas sales and decarbonise the grid.
•	Year around volume increase (not seasonal i.e. space heating in winter period).
•	Increase utilisation of existing assets for Transmission and Distribution Service Operators (T/DSOs).
•	Known and predictable customer acquisition costs.
•	Leading the transition from diesel to g-Mobility. 
•	Support decarbonisation of the gas grid and reduction in carbon footprint",,Riga,"CNG, gmobility, NGV, fueling, infrastructure",,2009,www.hygengroup.com,,LV,
