GRIDSEARCH,https://www.eu-startups.com/directory/gridsearch/,Romania,"n today's hyper-competitive market, attention is the new currency driving success. But at GRIDSEARCH, we understand that capturing attention is just the beginning. True excellence lies in how we focus, manage, and convert that attention into tangible results. By seamlessly integrating diverse sales channels into a unified ecosystem, we're not just attracting attention—we're transforming it into measurable growth. This is our vision for the future of e-commerce: where complexity becomes simplicity, and every customer interaction is a step toward business success.","It looks like you're interested in understanding the difference between e-commerce before and after implementing a multi-channel integration. Here’s a breakdown:
E-Commerce Before Multi-Channel Integration
Isolated Channels: Each sales channel (website, social media, physical store) operates independently, often leading to fragmented customer experiences.
Manual Management: Inventory, orders, and customer data need to be manually managed across each channel, increasing the risk of errors and inefficiencies.
Limited Reach: Businesses might be limited to one or a few sales channels, restricting their ability to reach a broader audience.
Inconsistent Branding: Maintaining a consistent brand experience across all channels can be challenging, as each platform may require different management strategies.
E-Commerce After Multi-Channel Integration
Unified Operations: All sales channels are integrated into a single platform, providing a seamless experience for customers across different touchpoints.
Automated Processes: Inventory, orders, and customer data are automatically synced across channels, reducing errors and freeing up time for other tasks.
Expanded Reach: Businesses can easily expand to multiple sales channels, including online marketplaces, social media, and physical stores, thereby reaching a larger audience.
Consistent Branding: Integration allows for consistent branding and messaging across all channels, improving the overall customer experience and brand loyalty.
Multi-channel integration is a strategic approach that not only streamlines operations but also enhances customer engagement and sales opportunities.",Alba Iulia,ecommerce/webshop/marketplace/Multi-Channel Integration,No funding announced yet,2022,https://integrator.gridsearch.ai,Active,RO,https://www.linkedin.com/company/gridsearch/about/?viewAsMember=true

Being aware of the beauty and richness of this country, we decided to launch a platform to promote responsible tourism, the kind of tourism that is closely linked to history and traditions. Based on solid principles, we managed to build one of the most appreciated tourism projects in Romania.
Initially, we started with the travel website www.wildventure.ro, but we quickly realised that there was need for more to be done. This is how we have come to the conclusion that by the end of 2019 we would launch the Travlocals.com platform, a modern platform where each user can book their desired experience, easily and fast, without having to pay any fees or commissions.
Our Mission
Travlocals.com is a project that supports sustainable development and social innovation, participating by all possible means in the restoration and enhancement of the heritage consisting of old buildings with tourist potential.
We believe that this way we can help the responsible development of many areas, decommissioned or otherwise, making local tourism an essential activity for economic sustainability.
The main purpose of Travlocals.com is to create a community interested in rural / cultural tourism and to facilitate interaction between its members. On the one hand, there are tourism service providers, and on the other hand, their consumers.
What differentiates us on the market
Travlocals.com has been designed from the start to be a different kind of platform. Basically, we do not think we would be wrong if we said that our platform was the only tourist platform in Romania focused on quality, not volume.
Our partners are selected following a careful analysis of the services offered and the reviews received in the online environment. Besides the quality criteria, we also consider other requirements, one of the most important being the authenticity of the services offered.
In this way, we want to bring to light the most beautiful experiences that a tourist can have in Romania and we hope that one day we can overcome the kitsch that has developed unbounded over the last 30 years.

We want to develop an app that brings together a community of users, who will find useful points of interest around their location. This app is directed towards all residents who know their neighborhood but still want to find a shop as close to them, and also to tourists who are looking for a shop.","The idea for this Android application came from the need to quickly find a shop nearest to the user. He/she can also add his/her own shops and choose the appropriate characteristics (credit cards accepted, 24/7 open time, meal tickets -> only for Romania). The user is only allowed to add when the GPS accuracy is around 10 meters in order to avoid users not finding shops and wasting time.
The user is located by GPS, and he/she has the option to choose from different types of shops:
- small shops,
- supermarkets,
- farmers markets,
- gas stations,
- shopping centers,
Each shop shows information about it like if credit card payments are accepted or not, if it is open 24/7.
The user can report certain characteristics of the shop and can also navigate to it using Google Maps. On the server side there is logic that intelligently deletes reported shops from the map if reported by different users and/or changes the shop characteristics.
The user is not allowed to report the same shop multiple times and is restricted to add certain number of shops daily. By that we want to avoid spamming. Our focus in Magazoo is to have shops that are correctly tagged and accurately positioned on the map.
Right now, only for Romania we have 8418 different shops on the map:
- 4973 small shops
- 1647 supermarkets
- 1673 gas stations
- 106 farmers markets
- 19 shopping centers

elapseit,https://www.eu-startups.com/directory/elapseit/,Romania,"Resource planning, time tracking and project management, from project kickstart to invoice.
Our goal is to build a workforce management platform that provides solutions and answers to almost all the questions that a manager or employee might have. From hiring your first employee or signing your first contract to invoicing the hours you’ve put into a project and getting paid, elapseit wants to help you keep everything simple, efficient, and under the same roof.","What is elapseit?
elapseit is the choice for all size companies, with features that cover:
•	Resource planning,
•	Project Management,
•	Task in Kanban board and Gantt view,
•	Time-tracking (approval workflow),
•	Projects (phases/ activities),
•	Leave management (approval workflow),
•	Invoicing and expenses,
•	Documents sharing,

•	Access levels,
•	Project budgeting,
•	Changing hourly/daily rates,
•	Real time stats. 
elapseit is user-friendly and easy to learn, just try it by signing up for a free trial!
DASHBOARD and REPORTS As a manager you will need to see what’s relevant for your business: accounts payable (no matter if you’ve invoiced in different currencies you will have the total amount converted into the currency choose by you), next pending invoices, top overdue invoices, top over-burn or under-burn projects and so on. Customized reports which help you in your business, starting from the basic timesheet, list of your employee’s time-off, billing, profitability, cost with your employees, forecast and so on, you can download them as pdf or csv.
MANAGEMENT
The starting point in using an application is to add the relevant data, in this case to add information about your clients, projects and people (users). All your projects are linked to a client, but you can have projects for the same client in different currencies, the client being a worldwide company.
Creating a project, with budget, hourly rates on project or on job titles (roles) for the entire project team, will give you a lot of information in clear charts in the project page. All the licensed users will be able to log hours on the project, or you can set for only the team members or the allocated people to log hours on the specific project. If you want to be even more in control that is possible, you can set if the hours logged on the project will be automatically approved or needs to be approved by a project manager assigned. You can split your project in phases and even activities (if you want to keep track of the small activities like meetings and such)
With regard to your employees/collaborators, you can keep every info that you need in a single place: hourly rate or monthly payment, currency, the number of vacation days per year, weekly working hours, department, location, and so on. 
RESOURCING
The resourcing planner is a Gantt like calendar where you can see at a glance who’s over-allocated or under allocated, who is available or not (in vacation or already working on projects). You can easily modify the allocation of a person on a project with drag and drop You can use the filters to see only the information that you need in that moment: only for specified projects, people, departments, locations, job title.
Most important, you can see all the allocations using the people view – to check the allocations per person, or project view – to see the budget of your project, to have a clear view of what is happening on each project, who is working on it, and how many hours did you allocate for each project member.
TASKS
Create tasks on each project, with estimated number of hours for completion and priority, assign them to members of your team and then follow their status. The views for tasks can be as list, Kanban and Gantt, you choose what is best for the project you work on or the information you want to see – if is the status and what is the number of tasks in each stage, you can use the Kanban project view, if you want to see the timeline and what will follow (dependencies) Gantt project view is the most helpful one. But you can also check the information in both Kanban and Gantt view per person, where you can see, for a certain user, what are the tasks that is working on and for what projects.
TIMESHEET
It has never been easier to be in control with hours logged by your team on different projects/phases/activities.
As a project manager you can schedule your team on projects and each user that has been allocated, when will log into the system will see their allocations and will be able to submit the hours (if the worked hours correspond with the allocated ones) or they can add a new project/phase/activity, if they worked more; if they worked less than allocated, they can simply modify and submit the accurate number of hours worked. If the project has been set up as hours logged to be approved by a project manager, then the project manager will check the hours submitted and can approve or reject them. After that, the user can submit the worked hours again. After the hours have been approved, the project manager or financial department can lock them so no one can modify anylonger the hours, so an accurate invoice can be created directly with just a few clicks. 
LEAVE
Leave management system (availability) is working together with the resourcing planner and timesheet. You will see on the resourcing planner who is off and for how long. You can approve or reject different types of days off and on dashboard you can even see the users who have time-off approved for a future period. One big aspect is that bank holiday has been integrated into leave management, so you don’t need to worry if a person is requesting a time-off during a period which includes a bank holiday because that day will not be taken from his/her vacation days. Also, the bank holidays can be set by location, so if your company is running multiple locations, just add the location for each user in their profile and check the bank holiday for their location, in Settings.
FINANCIAL
Invoicing and expenses are part of the Financial module. Invoices can be simple, as you edit rows and number or can be automatically created based on the timesheet (for time and material projects) and based on allocations or milestones(for fixed price projects); even after you populate them with information from the app, you can still edit them and download them to send be sent to your clients. The invoices can be translated in any language you need, by creating templates.
Expenses, depending on the access level, can be only created and submitted, or can created/approved/rejected. Create the expense in the currency you have on your travel documents in, assign it to a project and attach all the document needed before you submit it.
CUSTOMIZE YOUR BUSINESS’s ACCOUNT PREFERANCES
Although each user can choose the language for their account, you can customize your company profile account based on your preferences and change them whenever you want: 
Set maximum hours per day that an employee/collaborator can submit, default weekly working hours and the day you want the working with to start
Set a default currency (although you can personalize the currency for each project, the default currency will be used to show you dashboard information)
Set maximum vacation days per request and if the remaining days should be capitalize or reset (the month for reset), and what access level should see this type of information
Set default number of trackable leave (you can personalize for each employee from their profile)
Set different types of time-off: sabbatical, educational leave, maternal leave and so on. The app already provides you the following types: vacation, sick leave and home office.
Set the bank holidays per location
Set when to be notified, before project budget will be burned or allocation will exceed the project budget (%)
Create different departments (development, financial, administrative, HR, maintenance and so on)
Create different locations
Translate the invoice in your local language

Teransis Plus,https://www.eu-startups.com/directory/teransis-plus/,Romania,Blown wing system for increased UAV or aircraft operability in the market of Air Mobility and  B2B.,"Teransis Plus develops an electric blown wing system which increases the lift of an aircraft wing by a couple of times making the aircraft capable of taking-off and landing at a lower speed than a conventional aircraft while carrying higher payloads, this way making possible to operate from shorter runways and having an increased Air Mobility or Cargo Mobility. The electric blown system reduces the fuel consumption and extends the range during the cruise by decreasing the drag of the wing and Flying Green. The company has a prototype in TRL6 which confirmed the performance of the electric blown wing system.
This concept can be also applied in the renewable energy sector by integrating the blown system into the blades of a wind turbine thus increasing the total electrical energy by 30%.
The wind turbines have a low efficiency while the wind speed is low and they are not able to recover maximum wind kinetic energy. By integrating our blown system into the blades, the turbine is capable to recover more wind energy and the rotor spins faster than a rotor with conventional blades, thus increasing the delivered wind turbine electrical power by 30%.",Bistrita,"Flying green, Flying efficient, smart blade for wind turbine",Between €1-€100K,2013,https://teransisplus.com,Active,RO,https://www.linkedin.com/company/teransis-plus/
