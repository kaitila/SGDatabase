- Placeholder exercise, select exercise category and bodypart or a group of exercises and then select the actual exercise when working out, based on the feelings or what's free at the gym
- Custom keyboard to input workout data frictionlessly, allows to copy value from previous set, set value to all sets, and increment and decrement value
- Wrapped, see your year in review at the end of the year

If they are a good fit, they define goals (primarily to reach a new skill level) and agree on the frequency of their meetings. They then begin mentoring, which can be either paid or free. The mentee reports daily progress updates.
 
 Once the mentor and mentee agree that the goals have been achieved, they finalize the mentoring process. The mentor confirms that the mentee has improved their skills to a new level. After that, the mentor can vouch for their mentee to a recruiter looking for someone with the required skills.
 
 If the mentee is hired and successfully passes the probation period, it benefits everyone:
 - The mentor receives a reward,
 - The mentee gains additional skill validation,
 - The recruiter saves valuable time, avoiding hours of interviews with unsuitable candidates.""",,Krakow,"Mentorship, Education, Transparent Analytics",Between €100K-€500K,2024,https://www.webtree.org/,Active,https://www.linkedin.com/company/web-tree/,PL

Our robots perform physical labour in logistics, manufacturing and defence, replacing human workers in tough, repetitive, or dangerous environments. Designed with dual-use in mind, our systems are built for both industry and national resilience.","SI Robotics is creating the first industrial-grade humanoid robots designed and manufactured entirely in Europe. We develop cutting-edge bionic actuators and scalable robotic platforms that combine physical strength, human-like motion, and AI adaptability.
Driven by the urgent need to address Europe’s labour shortage, aging workforce, and defence vulnerabilities, we’re building robots that can lift, move, sort, and manipulate objects just like a human, but better. Our robots are more than machines; they are kinetic teammates designed to work alongside humans in logistics centres, factories, and high-risk environments.
Unlike traditional automation, humanoid robots offer flexibility and adaptability in real-world environments. They don’t require complex infrastructure or reprogramming for every task. They can be deployed in existing workplaces with minimal changes and begin delivering ROI from day one. Each unit replaces 2–3 low-skilled workers while operating 20 hours per day with near-perfect reliability.
At the heart of our technology are proprietary bionic actuators—high-performance, ultra-efficient motion units that mimic the dynamics of human muscles. We design and manufacture these actuators in-house, enabling unmatched energy efficiency, precision, and durability. This gives us total control over performance, cost, and scalability—something most robotics startups lack.
Our business model is built for scale. Just like the automotive and aerospace industries, we’re preparing for mass production from day one. From winding machines and coil magnetisation stations to in-house balancing and assembly, we’ve developed a full-stack production pipeline in Poland, which is Europe’s emerging defence hub.
Our robots are dual-use by design: they’re made to serve both industrial and military needs. Whether unloading trucks in logistics centres, restocking retail shelves, or assisting military logistics units, SI Robotics delivers tangible value. Our systems comply with strict safety and functional standards, making them viable for deployment across NATO-aligned countries.
We combine hardware with intelligence. Our humanoids are cloud-connected and powered by NVIDIA Jetson chips for local AI, with the option to scale up through on-site GPU mainframes controlling entire robot fleets. This hybrid approach enables fluid, natural movement and smart decision-making, without needing massive onboard compute.
Our long-term vision is to become Europe’s “Airbus of Humanoids”—a sovereign robotics infrastructure that reduces dependency on U.S. or Chinese technologies. We’re building not only the robots but the entire stack: hardware, production, deployment, and the SDK platform to invite AGI partners and third-party developers.
We’re backed by a growing ecosystem of industrial partners, academic institutions, and investors who understand that robotics is no longer science fiction. It’s the next great infrastructure revolution.
This isn’t just about building robots. It’s about building a future where physical labour is abundant, efficient, and safe-powered by European technology.",Warsaw,"humanoid robotics, dual-use, EU, AI",Between €100K-€500K,2024,https://sirobotics.eu/,Active,https://www.linkedin.com/company/si-robotics,PL
Zuzia.app,https://www.eu-startups.com/directory/zuzia.app,Poland,AI-powered server monitoring and task automation for Linux and VPS.,"Zuzia is an AI-powered platform for server monitoring and task automation. It lets you attach scheduled tasks to hosts and receive alerts when they fail, run too long, or behave unexpectedly. Designed for VPS users, Laravel Forge setups, and DevOps teams who need smart control over infrastructure without complexity.
Key Features
- Host Monitoring: Zuzia connects to your servers and monitors their health by running scheduled tasks and analyzing live responses. If something fails, runs too long, or returns unexpected output — you’re alerted instantly.
- Live Command Execution: Run shell commands directly from your browser and see real-time output from the server, without needing SSH access.
- Website & SSL Monitoring: Keep track of your websites’ uptime and SSL certificate validity. Get notified before downtime or expiration happens.
- Real-Time Notifications: Receive alerts via email or optional SMS the moment something goes wrong — no delays, no noise.
- Laravel Forge & VPS Ready: Easily integrates with Laravel Forge and works seamlessly with your own VPS infrastructure, making it ideal for both development and production environments.
Benefits
- Peace of Mind: You no longer have to worry about silent task failures or missed alerts — Zuzia watches over your infrastructure 24/7.
- More Time for Real Work: By automating repetitive server tasks and centralizing monitoring, Zuzia frees you up to focus on building, not babysitting.
- Early Problem Detection: Thanks to real-time AI analysis of task outputs and server responses, you catch issues before they escalate.
- No Complex Setup: Lightweight agent, simple interface, and no confusing dashboards — you can get started in minutes, not hours.
- Works with Your Stack: Whether you're on Laravel Forge, a custom VPS, or a hybrid setup, Zuzia fits in without needing to change your infrastructure.
- No Vendor Lock-In: You control your servers — Zuzia simply helps you monitor and automate them without taking over.
Use Case
Monitoring Veeam Backup Status (Free Edition):
You’re using the free version of Veeam Agent for Linux, which doesn't include email notifications or central monitoring. With Zuzia, you can create a recurring task that checks the backup status and sends an alert if something goes wrong — no more guessing if your data is safe.
Disk Space & System Load Monitoring:
Create tasks that periodically check available disk space or track what's using the most resources. Zuzia notifies you when thresholds are crossed, helping you prevent downtime due to full disks or overloaded servers.
Executing Commands Without SSH Access:
You're on the go, without access to SSH, and need to restart a service, check logs, or trigger a script.

Nebbl,https://www.eu-startups.com/directory/nebbl/,Poland,"Nebbl is a cloud storage platform that allows you to connect storage buckets from any S3 compatible provider, offering full control, zero-knowledge encryption, and flexible, pay-as-you-go pricing. It’s secure, limitless, and gives you complete ownership of your files.","Nebbl is a private cloud storage platform that empowers users with full ownership and control of their files by allowing them to connect directly to storage buckets from any provider. Think of it as your own private Dropbox, but with greater flexibility, enhanced privacy, and at a more affordable price.
Nebbl operates as a cloud storage management platform, enabling you to connect and manage storage buckets from multiple cloud providers simultaneously, all in one interface. The key distinction is that Nebbl doesn't sell storage space like traditional services. Instead, you link directly to your preferred cloud storage providers and use Nebbl to interact with the storage buckets you create yourself.
This model offers several major benefits:
Why Nebbl is Different?
1. Pay Only for What You Use:
With Nebbl, you’re only charged for the exact amount of storage you use, calculated daily. This means no more overpaying for storage space you don’t need. You have full control over your costs, ensuring you only pay for what you actually use.
2. Direct Cloud Storage Access:
Nebbl cuts out third-party intermediaries, connecting you directly to your chosen cloud storage provider (e.g., Backblaze, AWS, Google Cloud). This gives you full control over your files, allowing you to store, manage, and access them directly from your provider, ensuring that your data remains truly yours.
3. Zero-Knowledge Privacy with Client-Side Encryption:
Nebbl places a strong emphasis on privacy. It uses zero-knowledge encryption, meaning that only you can access your files. Even Nebbl has no visibility into your data. Through client-side encryption, your files are encrypted on your device before they’re uploaded to the cloud. This ensures that neither Nebbl nor your cloud provider can access or decrypt your files — only you hold the encryption key, guaranteeing complete privacy.
4. No File Size, Speed, or Quota Limits:
Nebbl imposes no restrictions on file sizes, transfer speeds, or storage quotas. Whether you need to store massive files or transfer large datasets, Nebbl gives you the freedom to store, upload, and download without any artificial limits.
5. Private and Secure Storage:
By connecting directly to your chosen cloud provider, your files remain fully under your control. Nebbl strengthens this with advanced encryption techniques to safeguard your data, ensuring that your privacy is maintained at every step.
6. Easy File Sharing:
Sharing files is effortless with Nebbl’s simple, customizable short links. With just one click, you can securely share large files with others, making collaboration quick and hassle-free.
7. Lifetime Access:
Nebbl offers a one-time payment option for lifetime access, eliminating the need for ongoing monthly fees. This gives you long-term storage freedom while minimizing recurring costs.
8. Affordable Pricing:
Nebbl's pay-as-you-go model ensures that you only pay for the storage you actually use. For example, storing 1 TB on Backblaze B2 costs as little as $0.20/day. This flexible pricing model makes Nebbl an affordable and cost-effective solution for both individuals and businesses.
Take Control of Your Cloud Storage
Nebbl gives you the flexibility, security, and cost-effectiveness that traditional cloud storage services can’t match. With direct cloud provider access, client-side encryption, and a pay-as-you-go pricing model, Nebbl ensures that your data is always in your hands — private, secure, and under your control.",Warsaw,#CloudStorage #SecureFileSharing #EncryptedStorage #ZeroKnowledge,No funding announced yet,2024,http://nebbl.com,Active,https://www.linkedin.com/company/nebbl,PL

There is no limit to our mobility, the trailer-based apartments can follow you anywhere, even the spots unreachable till now.
In today's fast-paced world, many of us dream about getting away ideally somewhere remote – far away from civilization and everyday problems. Of course, you can pack your backpack, take a tent and go hiking in the mountains, but such conditions can hardly be considered comfortable or cosy. Especially in wintertime it can’t be very restful. Camping isn’t everyone’s cup of tea. This is how Good Spot was born – a concept which meets the needs of people who want to relax “in the middle of nowhere”, without sacrificing the comfort of a 3-star hotel.
Good Spot offers comfortable apartments designed in refurbished refrigerated trailers. They can be parked anywhere in the world – one day they can be in high mountains, and the next day you can move them to a beach, desert or a forest. And the weather doesn’t matter. Our mobility has no limits
However, our main goal is not only to offer comfortable rooms; we want to take the hotel and tourism industry to a completely new level. How do we do it?
We need just 3 words: ecology, mobility, technology.
Good Spot is completely ecologically neutral. What's more – it will help stop further degradation of the natural environment, such as destruction of forests and fields for the construction of huge hotels and apartment buildings. Good Spot reverses this trend. Our apartments do not interfere with the surrounding nature. We build the them following the 3R principle: Reuse, Recycle, Reduce.
By reusing the trailers in the tourism industry, we change the waste management from linear to circular. I. Our plan to collect rainwater and, thanks to the water treatment system, supply the apartments with drinking water. Using photovoltaic system we will not have to rely on burning hard coal.
And you may ask, how do we use technology at Good Spot? We’re in the process of implementing  proRMS – an Artificial Intelligence system, based on neural networks, which learns the preferences of our guests. It monitors user behaviour, source of income and even weather forecast to make the experience even more attractive for guests and profitable for us.

platform, that finds you a great investment opportunity with data-driven, personalized
recommendations. We’re leveling the playing field for Investors, Business Owners, and buyers with the
most powerful force in the world: the truth. Our main focus is on providing the best solutions for the
business owners, investors, and High Net Worth individuals who are looking for Incentives of
International Investment. These incentives can be paying lower taxes, using local government
subsidies, joint cooperation with local partners, or getting residency, and citizenship by their
investments. The main challenge for this category of investors is finding the right case for
investment, hiring reliable brokers in the market, also finding local legal, and advisory firms to
perform their investments and obtain the incentives. There’s nothing worse than finding a surprise
after your investment, paying your hard-earned money and then finding out that the business that
you acquired, doesn't make any tax relief for you, or doesn't give you the residency opportunity. The
“perfect investment” is different for everyone, and it’s so much more than IRR or Annual Revenue.
Yet regular brokerage sites only give you that basic info. Want to know more about what are the
incentives that you can gain? you are on your own. ""Apastrof"" helps you find a great Investment
that’s just right for your lifestyle. Our team of data scientists, Financial analysts, and legal advisors
using the AI recommending system show you which investment is the best fit for your needs, and tell
you the whole truth about all procedures and costs that you will have to reach your ideal. No
surprises or regrets after investing. We’ve created a one-of-a-kind recommendation engine for
individuals and SMEs.",,Warsaw,"Invesmtment Recomender,",Between €1-€100K,2019,Apastrof.com,,,PL

MARKET
Every day, suppliers across the country have billions of zlotys blocked in their receivables, they wait on average 75 days for payment, and have limited and ineffective financing options.
Meanwhile, enterprises maintain a record level of cash, which at historically low interest rates brings record low profits.
Almost 2 million enterprises are active in Poland, including those with extensive supply chains as well as certain financial surpluses (according to the Central Statistical Office data, the financial liquidity index is> 35%) - medium and large - about 16 thousand, respectively. and 3.5 thousand At the end of last year, according to the KNF data, there was a total of over PLN 280 billion on Polish companies deposits. It is a huge, constantly growing amount (over 22% in the last 3 years), which can be managed more effectively. 88% of medium and large enterprises are looking for new alternatives.
On the other hand, 30% of companies from the SME sector benefit from external financing. The most valuable for them is: 33.3% short waiting time for cash, 24% low cost, 23.3% little formalities.
The SCFO platform, which is an innovative and unique solution on the market, offers both parties what they need the most: the fast, easy and cheap access to cash on demand for Suppliers and Buyers enables above-average profit without risk from capital surplus and improving the condition of the chain supply.

COMPETITORS
Buyers as the only option of investing their cash without risk have deposits or treasury bonds at a low rate. SCFO increases their profits enormously. From existing customer relationships, it appears that the effective annual rate of return for them varies from 5 to over 20%. We are convinced that none of the companies will pass by such an investment indifferently.
In turn, the suppliers, when financing themselves with factoring or loan, are exposed to the disadvantages of these products.
At the loan: huge bureaucracy - additional contracts and applications, limited access to finance only for companies with creditworthiness and good financial situation which excludes young companies.
For factoring: high cost - 3-4% of the invoice amount within 30 days, as well as necessity to verify and agree to the invoice of the contractor.
SCFO gets rid of these problems by offering an instant cash transfer thanks to the PSD2 directive, definitely lower cost than for factoring and credit - determined individually by the Buyers. SCFO is available to any supplier regardless of its history and financial situation, without unnecessary requests and additional contracts.
MOST IMPORTANT GOALS
We have established cooperation with Pekao S.A. and we want to test our solution in the regulatory sandbox they offer. The use of the PSD2 Directive and the PISP and AISP services will allow us to revolutionize and automate settlements between enterprises, which, combined with our Cloud Platform and accelerated payments, will give an unimaginable improvement in the functioning of enterprises. All the time we strive and we want to build awareness among entrepreneurs regarding this new, innovative cash flow management option. In addition, the ability to access the account (thanks to AISP) will enable us to use more variables to create a model based on data mining analysis, which will facilitate the selection of suppliers and the level of discount offered and increase potentially profitable earnings.
Next year we intend, thanks to cooperation established with Putka Sp. z o.o. sp. k. in the ScaleUp program, to which we were invited by Grzegorz Putka himself to develop the functionality of the Platform and fit it even better to market needs.
In further plans, after stabilizing our market position, we want to open to the markets of Central and Eastern Europe. Even now we get questions from corporations about whether they can also offer our Platform to their foreign contractors. Implementation process of a foreign company, does not differ from the implementation of the Polish company, which allows foreign contractors of the Polish companies to be the recipients in our model.

It is meant to be a fully operational research, design and production base for a wide branch of similar vehicles in the future. It will have the frame structure with as most universal base as possible in order to assure usage of a different kind of equipment installed onto it and different customized functionalities depending on the purpose and scope of work environment.
The vehicle will be a combination of self and cooperatively researched and devel. solutions (possibly the best battery dimension, weight, capacity; specially designed multi functioned main controller) and commonly accessible materials and parts (as aluminum; composites) used in a unique design. Altogether it will create a product that is expected to become a parametric determinant in the market.
The project idea was generated by a group of automotive enthusiasts and professionals who found a market pull for such product and planned their common way of developing it. Together they came up with a conclusion that what competitors can currently offer (also from pricing point of view) doesn’t comply with their ambitions and knowledge.
These 8 people making an use of their experience and studies in the fields of general automotive, electrics, automation, mechanics, transport, machinery development, maintenance, project management and other are a perfect base for a newly created company - Messor. The proj. goal fulfills the industrial niche they discovered and forms an answer to the team’s ambitions.
The core team is to be supported with other dedicated professionals (as planned) of specific branches, machines and tools to develop the product. A dedicated workspace and environment will be absolutely essential to realize the project.
Business proj. objectives will revolve around the principles ensuring the sustainable grow of our operation.",Poznan,,,2017,http://messor.pl/,,,PL

Huayra,https://www.eu-startups.com/directory/huayra-safe-multiple-cloud-manager/,Poland,"Cloud storage of data is becoming more and more popular. This is a very convenient solution, as it gives access to data from anywhere in the world. You don't need any portable drives or pendrives, what you need is just a computer with Internet access. This solution is available for anyone, often free, or at least inexpensive. However, there are also certain disadvantages of storing data in a cloud. Just remember the scandal with Edward Snowden, who revealed that such data could be accessed by all types of State authorities.  Naturally, this is not an issue for many people - after all, most of us have nothing to hide and are not afraid of government surveillance. However, reports of hackers getting to cloud user accounts and having full access to their data are published occasionally. These reports are more disconcerting for the average user. After all, we do not want strangers to review our private photos or, even worse, our work projects. Some clouds try to protect the privacy of their customers and offer data encryption, yet others communicate in their licensing arrangements that they have full access to user data. How can you handle the situation? A solution is the Huayra system, which secures cloud user privacy in multiple ways, while also offering much more added options. Huayra is not another cloud for storing data, it is a system that offers safe cloud management.

The main advantage of this system is that it encrypts user data with the most complex encryption algorithms. Encryption is applied in two stages, thus preventing brute force attacks. However, this is not the only method of securing data; in fact, data is split into parts, encrypted and sent to various clouds. With this arrangement, even in case of a hacker attack, your private data will not be available. The system providers do not store passwords and are unable to view user data. You can choose whether you want to encrypt all of your data, or just single files or folders.  When you use Huayra, you can rest assured that your data is safe. Sometimes people use several cloud accounts. With Huayra, you can access all your clouds from a single location and operate them on a copy-paste basis. Available storage space can also be increased continuously through adding new clouds. The only barrier that restricts writing and reading data from the cloud is your bandwidth. Huayra also offers multipoint on-demand synchronization and real-time synchronization. Huayra site is very easy to use, the interface has been developed for intuitive, trouble-free operation. At the moment, the site supports such clouds as Google Drive, One Drive, Dropbox, Box; it will be regularly expanded with clouds offered by other operators.   Huayra is not affiliated to any of the operators and as such, the company guarantees that no third parties will have access to user data.",,Warsaw,"Cloud storage, data",No funding announced yet,2015,https://www.myhuayra.com/,,,PL

Remote Support - allows frontline workers and technicians to consult unusual problems with remote experts from your organization.

Workflows - allow convenient mapping of real-world processes (hands-on training, service procedures, maintenance tasks, etc.), supplying them with multimedia content (instructions, images, videos, documentation, 3d models) and easy distribution across personnel equipped with AR glasses. Workflows can be used for, i.a., training, maintenance and service procedures, and assistance in day-to-day activities.
