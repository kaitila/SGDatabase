Modeled after MicroStrategy’s treasury approach, the company strategically accumulates and delegates Bittensor ($TAO) to generate compounding validator yield. Operating under a regulated Swiss equity structure with 10 million bearer shares, Tensor Suisse offers professional and qualified investors long-term exposure to the infrastructure layer of decentralized AI, without token custody or fund complexity.","Tensor Suisse AG (in Gründung) is an institutional-grade equity vehicle based in Zug, Switzerland, designed to provide direct and compliant exposure to the emerging sector of decentralized artificial intelligence. Our model draws inspiration from MicroStrategy’s strategic balance sheet approach — but instead of Bitcoin, our core focus is Bittensor ($TAO), a protocol enabling open-source machine learning through a decentralized validator network.
Our business model centers around three compounding value pillars:
Strategic accumulation of $TAO at early-stage valuations
Validator participation, producing protocol-native staking rewards (approx. 14–18% p.a.)
Equity-based NAV growth, rotating investor capital into the treasury with increasing traction
We are currently conducting a CHF 250,000 private placement for 4.25% equity (on a CHF 5.75M pre-money valuation), with ticket sizes starting at CHF 25,000. Investors benefit from early-stage access, a clear equity structure under Swiss law (no token), and exposure to a $50B+ market opportunity in AI and decentralized infrastructure.
Our structure avoids regulatory bottlenecks by not issuing tokens or managing third-party assets. Instead, investors receive shares in a Swiss AG with TAO as the underlying treasury engine — building long-term NAV, validator revenue, and future optionality (subnet participation, listing, M&A).
This investment is suited for professional investors, angels, and family offices looking for early access to disruptive infrastructure in AI and crypto, under a clear European legal framework.",Zug,"Decentralized AI, Bittensor TAO, Swiss equity, Crypto infrastructure, Validator staking",No funding announced yet,2025,https://www.tensorsuisse.com/,Idea Stage,https://www.linkedin.com/company/tensorsuisse/,CH

Quarero Robotics is a Swiss-based company at the forefront of security innovation, specializing in the development of AI-powered autonomous security robots. With a commitment to precision, efficiency, and reliability, Quarero Robotics combines Swiss engineering excellence with cutting-edge artificial intelligence to create next-generation security solutions that redefine surveillance and protection for businesses, public spaces, and high-security environments.
Our Mission
Quarero Robotics aims to enhance security and safety through advanced robotic solutions that complement and, in many cases, surpass traditional security methods. By integrating artificial intelligence, autonomous navigation, and real-time monitoring capabilities, Quarero Robotics provides security solutions that are both proactive and adaptive. The company's mission is to create a safer world by deploying intelligent, always-on security systems that reduce risks and improve incident response times.
Key Features of Quarero Robotics' Security Solutions
1. AI-Driven Surveillance & Threat Detection
At the heart of Quarero Robotics' security robots is advanced artificial intelligence, which enables real-time threat detection, facial recognition, and anomaly detection. These robots can analyze behavior patterns, identify potential security threats, and send instant alerts to security personnel, ensuring a swift and efficient response.
2. Autonomous Patrolling & Real-Time Monitoring
Unlike traditional security systems that rely on static cameras or human patrols, Quarero Robotics’ security robots autonomously navigate and patrol predefined areas. Their ability to move independently allows them to cover vast spaces efficiently, adapt to new environments, and provide continuous surveillance without the limitations of human fatigue.
3. 24/7 Security Without Breaks or Human Error
One of the most significant advantages of Quarero’s security robots is their ability to operate 24/7 without interruption. Unlike human security guards who require breaks, shifts, and rest periods, these robots provide constant surveillance, ensuring there are no gaps in security coverage. This uninterrupted monitoring significantly reduces the risk of security breaches and unauthorized intrusions.
4. Cost-Effective & Scalable Security Solutions
Deploying human security teams can be expensive, especially for large-scale operations that require extensive coverage. Quarero Robotics offers a cost-effective alternative that minimizes the need for large security teams while maintaining (and even enhancing) security effectiveness. Businesses can scale their security operations by deploying multiple robots that work in coordination, covering larger areas without proportionally increasing costs.
5. Adaptability to Various Environments
Quarero’s security robots are designed for use in diverse settings, including:
Corporate and Industrial Facilities: Protecting offices, warehouses, and manufacturing plants.
Public Spaces & Smart Cities: Enhancing security in parks, shopping malls, and transportation hubs.
Critical Infrastructure: Safeguarding energy plants, data centers, and high-security government sites.
Residential Communities & Private Estates: Offering homeowners a state-of-the-art security solution.
6. Integration with Existing Security Systems
Quarero Robotics' solutions are not standalone systems—they integrate seamlessly with existing security infrastructure, including CCTV networks, access control systems, and emergency response protocols. This interoperability allows businesses to enhance their current security setup without requiring a complete overhaul.
7. Data-Driven Insights & Incident Reporting
Security is not just about prevention but also about learning from incidents to enhance future responses. Quarero’s robots collect and analyze vast amounts of data, providing security teams with actionable insights. Detailed incident reports help businesses understand security trends, identify vulnerabilities, and optimize their protective measures.

Numarics was developed in 2020 by experts in the fields of accounting, digitalization, artificial intelligence and auditing  with the vision of seamlessly integrating accounting into the lifestyle of today's entrepreneurs.","Numarics – Your Digital Accountant: Swiss fintech start-up Numarics enables startups, SMEs and freelancers to do their accounting effortlessly and 100% digitally. With this strong business model, the founding team confirms the innovative strength of Switzerland as a business location.
Accounting, payroll, tax returns, invoicing, document management and much more are now streamlined via the Numarics ecosystem on the web or via app. Numarics has made the onboarding process incredibly simple - start-ups and SMEs can be activated on the platform in just a few minutes. Instantly, all the critical, administrative activities that are crucial to running a successful SME can be done in a digital and streamlined way via the Numarics app.
For entrepreneurs who want to organise their accounting seamlessly, independently and mobile.
The founders of Numarics believe that focusing on the core business leads to success - entrepreneurs focus on their key business and Numarics takes over administration and fiduciary services via the digital ecosystem.
Numarics was developed by experts from the fields of accounting, digitalisation, artificial intelligence and auditing. The founders have developed a digital and highly innovative ecosystem that is specifically tailored to the needs of entrepreneurs. With a consistent mobile-first approach, Numarics is Switzerland’s first accounting solution for startups and SMEs that can be completely controlled via a mobile app.
""Switzerland is a safe haven for businesses, and start up hubs like in Zurich are booming. It is simply outdated to still do your business administration with expensive accounting software and manually operating accounting providers. Numarics is the first digital accountant on the smartphone, providing an innovative ecosystem for Swiss startups,“ says Dominique Rey, Swiss Certified Public Accountant and CEO & Co-Founder at Numarics.
Users focus on their business - Numarics does the rest.
Co-founder Kristian Kabashi is an expert in the digitisation of business processes and is instrumental in digitising competent and reliable fiduciary services at Numarics. The digital expert believes that technology should be used to dedicate oneself to creativity by handling repetitive, administrative tasks technologically. In the process of developing Numarics, he has focused on the experience: ""The experience of accounting up to now has been the same as a visit to the dentist. You know you have to do it, but it's just no fun,"" Kabashi says, adding, ""With Numarics, running a business becomes the easiest thing in the world. Our users do their business, we do the rest.""
Numarics works and learns via intelligent algorithms. Each booking process is broken down from one minute to a few seconds. Documents are scanned with the mobile phone and categorised by setting filters. The app then learns from recurring expenses and income and consequently automates itself more and more, becoming faster and faster.
The founders are committed to creating a digital SME solution that is easy to use and absolutely transparent in terms of costs. Numarics is available for startups from only CHF 149 /month - the package includes all fiduciary services and financial administration for startups and SMEs: document management, accounting, financial statements, tax returns, VAT and payroll. Tax advice is provided via push notifications in the app. In the affiliated Numarics Academy, top experts such as Numarics Board Chairman and Professor for Finance Volker Doberanzke teach business management in free webinars. 
If users need specific information, entrepreneurs can book consultations with certified experts at Numarics at the click of a button. Various banking institutions can be connected to the Numarics ecosystem to provide the user with a fully integrated financial experience.
""Expat founders regularly have different needs. They only understand Swiss regulations and tax requirements to a limited extent - also because there are many terms that translate differently.

Syntheticus.ai,https://www.eu-startups.com/directory/syntheticus-ai/,Switzerland,Syntheticus provides a B2B SaaS solution that uses cutting-edge AI to generate synthetic data for different file formats and ensures that entities stay compliant while leveraging their data potential to boost innovation.,"📢 We live in a data driven generation where big data, data mining and artificial intelligence are revolutionising the ways we obtain value from data.
❗️ But the challenge is that public and private entities fall into data paralysis because of (1) data inertia and (2) data privacy. 
1️⃣ Data inertia: if you do not or only partially use your sensitive, personal data, then you have costs of opportunities of not unlocking your full data potential.
2️⃣ Data privacy: If you do use your sensitive, personal data, you risk security breaches and fines for noncompliance, which damage not only your reputation but ultimately also your foundation of trust.
🚀 Our B2B SaaS solution - a synthetic data generator - empowers you to unlock your data potential and strengthen your foundation of trust, while mitigating privacy risks. 
👉  And the technology for that is synthetic data. 
❓ What is synthetic data and what are its advantages?
💥  In a nutshell:
➡️ Artificially-generated, yet anonymized data that mimics the original data.
➡️ Mimics the original data by learning the correlations and thus keeping the statistical distributions as the original data.
➡️ Can be scaled to any size and can be sampled from unlimited times, making it highly efficient.
➡️ Being fully anonymized it cannot be reversed, as is the case with pseudonymization.
➡️ Compliant with existing regulations and exempt from potential fines and penalties.
➡️ Cost effective when compared to alternatives such as pseudonymization.
✅ Syntheticus enables you to avoid compliance issues and share synthetic data.
💡 Gartner predicts: By 2024, 60% of the data used for the development of AI and analytics solutions will be synthetically generated.
❓ A often asked question: How can I generate synthetic data?
💥 2 simple steps in <1min:
1️⃣  First upload your data
2️⃣  Set your desired parameters and let the engine generate synthetic, anonymised data.

1. AI-Driven Surveillance & Threat Detection
At the heart of Quarero Robotics' security robots is advanced artificial intelligence, which enables real-time threat detection, facial recognition, and anomaly detection. These robots can analyze behavior patterns, identify potential security threats, and send instant alerts to security personnel, ensuring a swift and efficient response.
2. Autonomous Patrolling & Real-Time Monitoring
Unlike traditional security systems that rely on static cameras or human patrols, Quarero Robotics’ security robots autonomously navigate and patrol predefined areas. Their ability to move independently allows them to cover vast spaces efficiently, adapt to new environments, and provide continuous surveillance without the limitations of human fatigue.
3. 24/7 Security Without Breaks or Human Error
One of the most significant advantages of Quarero’s security robots is their ability to operate 24/7 without interruption. Unlike human security guards who require breaks, shifts, and rest periods, these robots provide constant surveillance, ensuring there are no gaps in security coverage. This uninterrupted monitoring significantly reduces the risk of security breaches and unauthorized intrusions.
4. Cost-Effective & Scalable Security Solutions
Deploying human security teams can be expensive, especially for large-scale operations that require extensive coverage. Quarero Robotics offers a cost-effective alternative that minimizes the need for large security teams while maintaining (and even enhancing) security effectiveness. Businesses can scale their security operations by deploying multiple robots that work in coordination, covering larger areas without proportionally increasing costs.
5. Adaptability to Various Environments
Quarero’s security robots are designed for use in diverse settings, including:
Corporate and Industrial Facilities: Protecting offices, warehouses, and manufacturing plants.
Public Spaces & Smart Cities: Enhancing security in parks, shopping malls, and transportation hubs.
Critical Infrastructure: Safeguarding energy plants, data centers, and high-security government sites.
Residential Communities & Private Estates: Offering homeowners a state-of-the-art security solution.
6. Integration with Existing Security Systems
Quarero Robotics' solutions are not standalone systems—they integrate seamlessly with existing security infrastructure, including CCTV networks, access control systems, and emergency response protocols. This interoperability allows businesses to enhance their current security setup without requiring a complete overhaul.
7. Data-Driven Insights & Incident Reporting
Security is not just about prevention but also about learning from incidents to enhance future responses. Quarero’s robots collect and analyze vast amounts of data, providing security teams with actionable insights. Detailed incident reports help businesses understand security trends, identify vulnerabilities, and optimize their protective measures.
Why Choose Quarero Robotics?
Quarero Robotics stands out in the security industry due to its commitment to innovation, reliability, and excellence. By leveraging artificial intelligence and autonomous technology, the company offers security solutions that go beyond conventional approaches. Businesses and organizations that require state-of-the-art, scalable, and cost-effective security solutions can rely on Quarero’s expertise to meet their needs.
Experience the Future of Security with Quarero Robotics
Security is evolving, and Quarero Robotics is leading the way. By embracing AI-driven, autonomous solutions, organizations can enhance their security posture, reduce operational costs, and ensure continuous protection against emerging threats.

METHANOLOGY AG,https://www.eu-startups.com/directory/methanology-ag/,Switzerland,"METHANOLOGY AG (MY) develops a power to liquid (PtL) energy storage, e-fuel production and CO2-capturing
system, that uses renewable electricity and CO2 from the environmental air or biogenic CO2 to produce renewable,
clean methanol by a bio-electrocatalytic process. Methanol contains three times the hydrogen power than
compressed hydrogen (@700bar) per volume!","The final goal of this project is to develop the PtL-technology and later sell/distribute a device that produces e-methanol to store energy in liquid form on an existing infrastructure (storing, distributing, fueling).
This device addresses individual, decentralized energy storage, as well as larger, industrial scale applications. A patented bio-catalytic process converts water and CO2, adding electricity from renewable sources, to e-methanol. The used technology works with carbonized water as well as with captured atmospheric CO2.
All of this addresses three points:
- Making renewable energy storable during overproduction in high-times, to be used during low-times (night/winter-gap)
- Capturing CO2 from CO2 intense industries (sewage treatment, bio-gas facilities, etc.)
- Producing e-methanol (storing energy) where renewable energy and/or CO2 cumulates and distributing it with a readily available network in stead of using the electric grid which is not up for the task.
Methanol currently is the basis of all our industrial and mobility needs:
- Converting it back to electricity by fuel-cell when needed
- Using it as an e-fuel for current and future combustion engines (cars, ships, planes, construction machines, furnices, etc.)
- Methanol is the basis for thousands of industrial processes (plastics, chemistry, pharma, etc.)
This whole PtL-concept (e-methanol) is currently gaining a lot of traction, especially in large industrial applications and thus not new in itself.
USP of METHANOLOGY is that all of this is achieved by our own biocatalytic process (enzymes). Same as ones's liver produces water and CO2 from alcohol, these highly developed dehydrogenase
enzymes reverse the process. (https://chemistry-europe.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/cssc.201501496)
This brings a number of advantages:
- Direct conversion to e-methanol from the liquid (H2O+CO2). No electrolysis in the traditional sense to produce hydrogen necessary
- Traditional Fischer-Tropsch-synthesis requires high pressures and high temperatures. METHANOLOGY's
process works at low pressure and almost room-temperatures, extremely increasing efficiency for small
applications and adding safety which enables even home-installations.
This technology allows METHANOLOGY to enter a totally new and inexistant market that is irrelevant for large competitors but yet seamlessly works together with all the forces on the forefront of a fossil-free future. Our technology is capable to cope with all diversities of application and scale.",Neuhausen am Rheinfall,"PtL, e-methanol, enzymes, carbon-free",Between €1 million-€ 2.5 million,2020,www.methanology.com,,,CH

However, today’s industrial microencapsulation techniques do not allow any control over the capsule size, leading to uncontrolled release profiles. 
Our unique technique enables the industrial production of size-controlled 
microcapsules, while offering precise dosing, controlled release properties, and an increased stability, all of which being 1000x faster than state-of-the-art processes. 

Microcaps brings, for the very first time, industrial precision and control to the rapidly growing 12 bn-$ market of microencapsulation.","Microcapsules and microparticles are industrially used to protect and deliver active materials, such as drugs in medication, fragrances in creams and aromas in food. Today’s microencapsulated materials have neither control in actual particle size nor in their size distribution. Hence, the final products often have unknown release profiles, poor dosage control, and a decreased stability over time. Until today, state-of-art microfluidic techniques only work with very little volumes as they lack scalability and stability. Therefore, a trade-off between large production volumes and monodispersity has to be found. However, with Microcaps this trade-off is resolved, our technique enables laboratory Swiss precision at industrial scale. Large production volumes of size-controlled (monodisperse) microparticles,-emulsions, and -capsules, are now possible by upscaled microfluidics. Moreover, our emulsification platform has the advantage of being highly flexible (10 to 2000µm particle size) and adaptable (chemical components and batch sizes) , as well as being robust and cost-effective.",Zurich,"microparticles, pharmaceutics, medication",,2019,https://www.microcaps.ch/,,,CH

to dispense with any external control components during construction, but also to simultaneously record data such as people movements and energy consumption in real time.","The company, founded in 2017, is reinventing lighting: LEDCity has set itself the goal of ridding the world of obsolete motion detectors and light switches. Motion detectors are a half-century-old invention, which are expensive and complex to install. Due to the central control, they can also control the light only very sluggishly. A decentralized, sensor-controlled and AI-optimized lighting system can solve this problem, saving 50-70 percent more energy than modern LED systems. Thanks to up to five integrated sensors and a small computer per light source, the light source can decide precisely when and how much light is needed in addition to natural light. The startup claims to have developed the
world's most energy-efficient lighting system. At the same time, it aims to optimize building operations by evaluating data from thousands of sensors.
Since the start, LEDCity has acquired 370 customers, founded two subsidiaries, hired over 30 employees, and won six awards in 2021. Other supporters of LEDCity include the Swiss Federal Office of Energy, the Swiss Climate Foundation, several investors, and well-known
board members. Thanks to the first round of financing for the sum of two million euros, the first cornerstone for growth was laid. This enabled the company to hire the first employees in Spain and Germany, to further optimize the products and offer additional software as services solutions (SaaS).

consumption of 8,000 households through the implemented projects but also to increase the revenue by almost 100 percent to more than three million dollars in 2021.",Zurich,"Sensor, controlled, lighting, system",Between €1 million-€ 2.5 million,2017,https://ledcity.io/,,,CH

Jelurida Swiss,https://www.eu-startups.com/directory/jelurida-swiss-sa/,Switzerland,"Blockchain-based technologies are revolutionizing the world as they are applied to new and existing business models. Jelurida is a pioneer blockchain software company that enables enterprises to quickly adapt the blockchain technology using the Nxt and Ardor technologies. 
The Nxt blockchain is available for public and private use, with a five-year development history, proven stability, a massive community, and a well established proof-of-stake model. Moreover, with its last launch, with the Ardor blockchain-as-a-service platform, oriented to make the adoption even easier, Jelurida takes a highly competitive place in the blockchain landscape. 
Some of the solutions that companies can build on Nxt and Ardor are a monetary system (i.e., for creating social coins), an asset exchange, a data cloud to manage digital storage, a voting system, a system to make smart and conditioned (phasing) transactions, and more.","One of the main bottlenecks of existing smart contract technology is that it requires every node in the blockchain to process every contract to reach the same state. But is this really necessary?
In Ardor, we implemented a different approach which is more flexible and scalable. Instead of requiring every node to process every contract invocation, we ask only the parties interested in the contract to process it and verify that they reach the same state.
With this approach, the contract code itself is a simple Java class uploaded to the blockchain and therefore digitally signed and time stamped. However, the execution of the contract is only performed by nodes who selected to run the ContractRunner addon.
The input to the contract is typically a transaction with an attached message, which identifies the contract to execute, and supplies optional parameters. The output of the contract are one or more transactions submitted to the network to update the blockchain state. The transactions submitted by the contract are normal transactions which have to comply with all the existing protocol rules.
In other words, the lightweight contract, is Java code which implements a certain interface, stored on the blockchain. The contract code is executed by anyone who wants to run it, not by every node, and is triggered by a blockchain transaction (or by each new block). The result of the calculation made by the contract is submitted as one or more normal transactions of any type supported by Ardor.
What can it be used for? Lightweight contracts provide essentially everything Ethereum smart contracts are used for, integrated with everything Ardor already provides out of the box. Such as automation of repetitive tasks, Financial calculations, Predictable random numbers, Oracles to register information from external sources, and more. All this is integrated with the existing built in Ardor Coin Exchange, Asset Exchange, Voting Tools, Marketplace, Account Properties, Messages, etc. This provides a powerful tool for developing decentralized applications by relying on existing built in API features.
But, how do we make sure that whoever executes the smart contract does not cheat? Since the Java class file is stored on the blockchain, anyone interested can execute the same contract based on the same input, either in production mode, in order to submit the output as a transaction or in approval mode to verify that a transaction submitted by a contract indeed followed the correct calculations.",Lugano,"blockchain, asset, data",,2016,www.jelurida.com,,,CH

Since then, the company has developed two generations of its innovative capsule-based synthesis instrument and a wide range of reaction applications and cartridges.

Today, its growing, global customer base has readily adopted the technology in their synthetic laboratories.

For more information on Synple Chem, please visit the website https://synplechem.com","The idea for Synple started back in 2015. At the time most of us were still working in the Bode group at ETH, where we had just launched the SnAP reagents commercially. We were getting a lot of feedback about how powerful the SnAP method was but it was clear that some people were uncomfortable handling the tin and that there was some variability in the results depending on how experienced the chemist was with SnAP chemistry and what their source of reagents was. During one of our meetings we discussed how great it would be if we could encapsulate all the reagents needed for the reaction and then have an automated machine in which one could simply add the cartridge and press go. Thus our “coffee machine for chemistry” concept was born.
Benedikt started the development of the machine during the last year of his PhD and as a small team we worked to develop the optimized reaction sequences and reagent cartridges that would enable the machine to carry out not only the reaction but also the work-up and purification in a fully automated manner. Following development of the basic proof of concept, we founded Synple Chem and subsequently secured seed investment that enabled us to produce and test a beta version of our technology with customers across pharma, biotechs, CROs and academia.
Since completion of the pilot phase we have launched a new version of the machine and have added many more reaction class to the technologies capabilities. Today we have customers across Europe, the US and Asia and we continue, as a relatively small team, to develop new reaction classes and expand the applicability of the machine.

We are a good-weave certified rugs company. Our motto is to be on track for sustainable growth while caring for our employees and customers.","Our family started manufacturing rugs in 1988 but did not try to expand to the export market. We foray into the export market in 2014 when the co-founder Dr. S.S Nandal joined the family business after retirement from Government Service. Since then, we have never looked back and are on our way to continuous growth. 
Our goal is to maintain growth with sustainability. We expect to grow fourfold in the next four to five years. We are a company that focuses on staff betterment, customer satisfaction, and customer retention. In accordance with our current growth rate and foray into new product categories, we also expect to become a complete home furnishing Solution Company in the near future.

Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) in Public Administration (Specialization in Sports Administration ) 1988. Second is Dr. Shakuntala nandal, Ph.D. in Home science, a retired Associate professor from the education department and now a chief designer in M.G. Creations. Our third Co-founder, Sh. Kuldeep Singh is a textile manufacturing veteran and has 40 years of experience in the home furnishing industry.

Our in-house designing team always comes up with spectacular and eye-catching designs, which are completely new in the market, and therefore, we have now become a trendsetter in our sector.  
X-factor lies in the management of the manufacturing process. The real culprit of the high manufacturing costs of handmade items is the wastage of raw materials in production. We have a strict policy on zero-waste production methods. All the by-products of export-order products are used to manufacture cushion fillers for the local market.
