Designed from agency feedback, TimTodo focuses only on what really matters and continues to evolve to stay even more intuitive and user-friendly.","TimTodo is designed with agencies in mind — creative, marketing, digital, or software teams that juggle multiple projects, clients, and deadlines every day. Many agencies told us they avoid using project tools altogether because existing solutions are overloaded with features and too complex to adopt. That’s exactly why we built TimTodo: to give agencies a tool that focuses on the essentials and makes their work easier, not harder.
With TimTodo, agencies can create and manage projects, assign tasks with deadlines, set priorities, and keep every team member aligned. Built-in time tracking lets employees log hours on tasks effortlessly, while managers gain full visibility into where time is spent. By defining hourly rates and internal costs, agencies can immediately see the profitability of each project, client, or even individual team member. This helps answer the most critical questions: Are we charging enough? Which projects are losing money? Where is our team’s time best invested?
The platform also simplifies reporting and invoicing. Agencies can generate clear reports for internal use or client transparency, and turn tracked work into professional invoices in just a few clicks. This not only saves admin time but also ensures that no billable hour is lost.
Collaboration is straightforward: team members can comment on tasks, attach files, and share updates without switching tools. Clients can also be granted access to specific projects, creating transparency and building trust.
TimTodo isn’t about giving you every possible feature — it’s about giving agencies the right features. Simple, focused, and practical.

Projekt nabízí jasně definovaný systém, který může být snadno implementován jako online program, aplikace nebo součást wellbeing služeb firem. Díky unikátnímu mixu psychologie, výživy a mindfulness má velký potenciál na trhu zdravého životního stylu, který každoročně roste o desítky procent.

NeDieta není klasická dieta ani přísný jídelníček. Je to holistický koncept, který klade důraz na vědomé jedení, hluboký respekt k signálům vlastního těla a kvalitu potravin. Místo omezování a počítání kalorií učí uživatele, jak si vybudovat zdravý, udržitelný vztah k jídlu, který snižuje stres, podporuje lepší trávení a přirozenou regulaci váhy.

This is where Ageware comes in. Our solution is based on state-of-the-art biometric security software and an award-winning facial recognition algorithms. All it takes for a user to be age-verified is to take a selfie and our software does the rest. It is paramount to us that the information of the user will never be available to the website operator, ensuring absolute privacy, while effectively restricting access only to appropriate audiences. This process usually takes 5-15 seconds, and is the least disruptive actual age-gating solution on the market. For a website operator, installing Ageware is a matter of simply implementing a snippet of code into their website. No heavy coding or website alterations are required.

Starting with football - the biggest sport in the world - real experience meets digital reach. Via live video stream, an unlimited number of online gamers (digital) can control a physical machine and compete against live athletes (real). 
Set on a physical stage, a customized football launcher is paired with a large high-end LED panel behind a standard-sized goal and combined with a professional broadcasting system. A real human goalkeeper on stage awaits the digital players for the live streaming session, giving gamers around the world the chance to shoot balls and score goals against the athlete on their mobile device.
By encouraging players to pass multiple rounds of the elimination game, one gamer then gets the chance to take full control over the launcher in the final round. By utilizing famous goalkeepers and other VIPs, this unique approach allows fans from all over the world to engage with their idols while offering extreme exposure to brands and talents alike.
The technology, which allows multiple people to play at the same time, involves various advanced mathematical calculations running in the background. Simply put: Each round, an average target will be calculated after all players have inputted their data and the elimination process will narrow it down to one single player in the very last round.
An offline version of the game keeps users entertained 24/7. Collecting LivePoints during any game helps to improve the gamers’ skills, rising through the ranks and eventually granting access to exclusive VIP events reserved for only the best players.

Challenge
Any human activity and digital behaviour in Cyberspace are generating data and, at the same time, is influenced by various data analytics. When buying anything online, we are usually being hit by an unpleasant experience of remarketing storm. No matter what customer does, actual remarketing deadlock algorithms, do not allow experience on anticipated customer future needs, on the contrary, it creates immense spam. This deadlock is driven by two key triggers: 1) the actual state of the online advertising industrys business model: driven solely by
the number of clicks and views, but not by the real conversion rate and 2) inability of the industry to predict what the customers really need, lacking the personalization element.
Our solution
We are building Behavee as a global open-source Personalization Platform  a service for real-time personalization based on anonymized behavioural data and dynamics of micro-segmentation. We aim to be a democratic and superior European player.
COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE
There are several platforms on the market utilizing partially the behavioural analytics. None of the platforms runs as an open-source - open platform and lacks the ability to openly cross-sell goods between its clients. Majority of these solutions lack true
microsegment focus and are not able to investigate future offers. Mostly generating offers from the past. In the long
run, our competitors can become Behavee partners because their business models can benefit from our platform and its open nature of anonymized data sharing. In general, our main goal is to create a platform open to other partners.",Prague,"data, analytics, human activity, digital behaviour",,2018,https://www.behavee.com/,,,Czechia

Send us those photos and we will send you back the actual as-built documentation certified by officially authorized land survey engineer. Part of the outputs is also a 3D model of the construction (we can implement it into our 3D CheckGIS). 

CheckGIS
Our flagship of software services is CheckGIS (www.checkgis.com), our author's version of a geographic information system. It is a maximally effective tool for displaying both 2D and especially 3D data that help users with orientation, visualization and basic measurement in the displayed area of interest.","Product innovation:
CheckPhoto consists of several processes which are uniquely linked together. Most importantly - it is a viable business model for CheckTerra and it solves the customers' main problems - remote management, monitoring and verification. It involves high-tech yet easy to operate equipment such as GoPro camera or DJI drones.
CheckGIS is of a simmilar nature. Although there are several GIS solutions currently available on the market (ESRI, QGIS etc.), all of them are rather robust, complicated and needs to be used by expert only. Therefore, the entry treshold is too high. CheckGIS offers a true opposite - it is intentionally designed in a very simple way. It's goal is the easiest way to access 2D and 3D GIS data to the widest range of customers, vertically throughout the whole company (from a worker at a construction site up to the company director).
Problem we solve for customers
CheckPhoto solves the customers' main problems - remote management, monitoring and verification. CheckPhoto simply allows accurate mapping (documentation) of areas or points of interest without the physical presence of an expert (geodesic surveyor) on the site. Obtaining these accurate geodesic data allows for developing projects that could not be pursued otherwise due to security and financial reasons.
CheckGIS allows you to instantly display accurate information and helps you to quickly create an idea about the area of interest, together with the use of a wide range of useful tools. It gives you a significant advantage in the decision-making process and helps to find the right solutions in time.
CheckGIS - with regard to the above mentioned facts - is useful, user-friendly and practical tool and therefore highly desirable not only for executives of private companies worldwide but also for donors representatives which are responsible for multinational projects. In conjunction with CheckPhoto, you can instantly control your projects around the world from the comfort of your office.",Hostomice,"photo, services",No funding announced yet,2013,www.checkphoto.eu,,,Czechia
