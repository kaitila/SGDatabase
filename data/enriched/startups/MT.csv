Thundercrawl â LLMs.txt Generator,https://www.eu-startups.com/directory/thundercrawl-llmstxt-generator/,Malta,Thundercrawl is a cutting-edge tool designed to supercharge your website's visibility by generating AI-friendly LLMs.txt files,"Thundercrawl is a cutting-edge tool designed to supercharge your website's visibility by generating AI-friendly LLMs.txt files. Tailored for large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini, Thundercrawl transforms your website content into structured, markdown-formatted text files that enhance AI comprehension and drive referral traffic from AI-powered platforms. With a free test option, users can convert up to 5 pages, 10 blogs, and 10 products into an LLMs.txt file, ensuring your site is easily discoverable by AI systems. For advanced needs, premium plans offer expanded capabilities, including full-site crawls and customizable processing options.

Unleash your website’s potential today at https://thundercrawl.com. © 2025 Thundercrawl.com - Empowering the world with lightning-fast solutions.What is LLMs.txt?LLMs.txt is a proposed web standard designed to make website content more accessible and understandable to large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini. Unlike traditional SEO files like robots.txt (which controls search engine crawling) or sitemap.xml (which aids discovery), LLMs.txt provides a markdown-formatted file that curates and summarizes a website’s most important content in a clean, AI-friendly format. Hosted in a website’s root directory (e.g., yourwebsite.com/llms.txt), it helps LLMs efficiently process key information, such as API documentation, product details, or blog summaries, without navigating complex HTML structures, navigation menus, or ads. Key features of LLMs.txt include:Structured Markdown Format: Contains an H1 header with the site’s name, a blockquote summary, and sections with curated links or full text to guide AI models to high-value content.
AI Optimization: Enhances visibility in AI-generated responses, improving accuracy and relevance in chatbot answers or AI-driven search results.
Versatility: Useful for developers (e.g., for API documentation), businesses (e.g., for product descriptions), or personal sites (e.g., for CVs or portfolios).
No Blocking: Unlike robots.txt, it doesn’t restrict access but acts as a “treasure map” to direct LLMs to the most relevant content.
By implementing LLMs.txt, website owners can boost their site’s discoverability in AI-powered interactions, potentially increasing referral traffic and ensuring accurate representation in AI responses. Tools like Thundercrawl simplify the creation of these files, making it accessible for marketers, developers, and site owners.",Sliema,"llms.txt, llms txt, llms.txt generator, llms txt generator, llm.txt, llm txt, llm txt generator, thundercrawl",No funding announced yet,2025,https://thundercrawl.com/,Active,,MT

Our mission is to help cities make better decisions about how to allocate resources and plan for the future of smart cities.
Greenroads has developed a state-of-the-art AI platform that can be used to gather meaningful information from internet-connected cameras and footage captured by drones, giving urban planners and authorities access to new data sources with which to take data-driven decisions. Our vision is for our cloud based and privacy preserving data pipeline to become the backbone for the collection and processing of mobility data around the world.
Our software can automatically handle all types of mobility and has a special focus on active mobility such as the safety of pedestrians and cyclists. It is already being used in Europe to understand the movement of vehicles and pedestrians, identify congestion, and measure the impact of transportation network upgrades and policies. We are planning to expand to the MENA and North American markets in the near future.
Working together with leading academics in the field, we are presently in the process of extending our data pipeline to allow for predictive and rerouting analysis in case of disturbances to the infrastructure, such as road closures or sudden increases in traffic influx.
We seek to grow both vertically, providing a solution that seamlessly connects infrastructure to smart vehicles to help reach zero road deaths, and horizontally, applying our technologies to specific markets such as security of controlled-access areas or monitoring of smart parks.
Greenroads has been highly successful in attracting competitive European Union grant funding. This has helped us bootstrap our start-up and finish our MVP. The resulting product is being made commercially available to prospective clients internationally.
The European Commission has recently labelled Greenroads as a ‘key innovator’ on its Innovation Radar.

generate.TAX,https://www.eu-startups.com/directory/generate.tax,Malta,generate.TAX is a tax suite that seamlessly connects to your accounting software and helps accountants and finance teams with statutory tax compliance/obligations.,"generate.TAX stemmed from a realisation that there was a gap in existing accounting software, such as Xero, which lacked functionality to support specific local requirements with regards generating tax and VAT reports. 
Accountants and finance professionals needed to adhere to strict local regulations, but current software didn't provide the necessary localised tools or data for them to fulfil their responsibilities with ease. This resulted in additional manual work to ensure compliance, increasing the risk of errors and wasting valuable time.
Recognising this unmet need, we began by developing a solution tailored to the Malta market. We saw a clear requirement for a tool that could handle VAT submissions efficiently through a software that integrates seamlessly with existing accounting systems to automate the generation of VAT returns.
The result is a system that is designed to benefit both accountants and businesses. For accountants, it simplifies VAT return preparation by extracting data from the accounting software and generating VAT reports with just one click. Additionally for businesses, it helps manage VAT deadlines and settle liabilities efficiently, minimising misstatements and enhancing financial control and compliance. Designed to be a comprehensive solution for all VAT activities, generate.TAX’s features include Compliance Reminders, an Invoice VIES Checker, Return Preparation, Record-Keeping, Audit Trails, and a Return Generator.
After launching in Malta and receiving positive feedback and adoption from industry professionals, we explored the broader EMEA region and discovered that similar challenges existed elsewhere. As a result, we expanded our software’s functionality to address the needs of additional countries such as Cyprus, Ireland, UAE, Isle of Man, Sweden, and the Netherlands. We also incorporated other VAT-related services, such as recap statements and a VAT number checker, to ensure comprehensive support .",Malta,"VAT, VAT Returns, VAT Return Generator, VAT Number Checker",No funding announced yet,2023,https://generate.tax,Active,https://www.linkedin.com/company/generate-tax/,MT

Integration with Online Spreadsheets
The software integrates online spreadsheets, enhancing the accessibility and usability of working papers:
Ease of Reference: Because these spreadsheets are connected to the rest of the audit software, referencing working papers is straightforward and efficient.
Advanced Testing Features: The integration of OCR (Optical Character Recognition) and AI functions aids auditors in their testing procedures, allowing for more accurate and comprehensive data analysis.
Financial Statements and Audit Letters
Finally, Sheetsway can instantly generate financial statements and relevant audit letters. This capability not only speeds up the audit process but also ensures consistency and accuracy in the final audit outputs.
Time Savings

This efficiency gain not only benefits the auditors, in terms of reduced workload and faster completion times but also their clients, who can expect quicker audit results and less disruption to their operations.
In summary, Sheetsway is a comprehensive AI audit software that revolutionizes the audit process by automating key tasks, facilitating real-time communication between auditors and clients, and integrating advanced tools for data analysis and report generation, all of which contribute to significantly increased efficiency and accuracy in auditing activities.",San Gwann,"AI, OCR, TECH, SOFTWARE",No funding announced yet,2023,https://sheetsway.com/,Active,,MT

We are living in a changing world. Soon every company, every place, and even every person will produce a rapidly growing data lake in the blink of an eye. Today’s data economy uses a fragment of this data to create new machine learning algorithms and sell them back to society. Instead of empowering new IoT markets, encouraging everybody’s data ownership, stimulating the IoT ecosphere’s sovereignty, and democratizing IoT data, the IoT platforms of today reinforce the revenue circle for the problematic monopolies of today’s IT industry. For the infinitely meshed IoT of tomorrow, which offers participation on a wide scale including companies, public places, private sectors, and individuals, we need collaboration as a service delivered by an emancipating platform.   offers this open, scalable, and ultra-secure platform with its three pillars: connect, manage, and build.
