beeco,https://www.eu-startups.com/directory/beeco/,Hungary,"Beeco solves the gap between people who want to live sustainably and the hidden solutions around them. Individuals face eco-anxiety, misinformation, and a lack of transparency, while eco-friendly SMEs struggle to gain digital visibility and reach conscious consumers. Beeco connects the two sides with a green map, event calendar, coupons, gamified challenges, and education—turning sustainable living from something overwhelming and isolating into something simple, social, and rewarding, while helping local green businesses thrive.","Beeco: Turning eco-anxiety into collective action
Beeco is a digital ecosystem that empowers people to live more sustainably while helping local green businesses thrive. Our mission is to make sustainable living simple, social, and rewarding by connecting individuals, communities, and SMEs through one engaging platform.
At the core of Beeco is a green map, where users can easily discover eco-friendly locations around them zero-waste shops, repair cafés, bike services, refill stations, recycling points, sustainable restaurants, and more. This is complemented by an event calendar that highlights local green activities such as workshops, volunteering opportunities, and climate marches, allowing people to connect with communities and take action together.
To lower the barrier to sustainable choices, Beeco integrates a coupon system offering discounts from eco-friendly SMEs. For users, this makes greener options more accessible; for SMEs, it provides digital visibility and direct access to conscious consumers. In addition, Beeco features gamified challenges and competitions, rewarding users for sustainable actions such as tree-watering, attending events, or redeeming coupons transforming eco-friendly behavior into a fun and motivating experience.
Education is central to our platform. Users can access an educational feed with videos and quizzes, as well as a personal footprint calculator, helping them measure, understand, and reduce their environmental impact step by step.
Beeco is more than just an app it is an open platform for sustainability campaigns and collaborations. Our successful Volunteer Watering campaign mobilized thousands of citizens to protect urban trees during hot summers, showing how Beeco can unite communities around tangible climate action.
With 15,000+ users and 30 subscribing partners in Hungary, we are now preparing for international expansion, starting with Sweden, Germany, and Spain.

Innovative Hungarian invention, which was judged as a successful innovation by the Hungarian Innovation Association in 2022. Manage your machines automatically 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.

The element of the Agrosentinels Diagnostic Measuring System is a smart sensor that continuously monitors the critical points of the machines. If it detects abnormal operation, it will immediately send you an alert and/or perform immediate automatic intervention on the machine.

 

The sensor communicates with the master unit via a BLE connection, which can even intervene in the control of the agricultural machine in the event of a problem.


The sensor not only sends the data to the phone, but also saves them immediately in the cloud, so they can be reviewed and evaluated at any time later. Thanks to the magnetic fastening, the installation of the sensors is extremely easy.","The measuring system capable of monitoring the parameters of bearings and related components in real time. The system can measure several parameters at the same time. These parameters are: infrared temperature, ambient temperature, vibration, humidity, acceleration and temperature change. The sensors are responsible for accurate measurement, the number of which can be up to 22 within a system. The sensors communicate wirelessly and are powered by a battery.
The sensors send the data to a router, which forwards the data to a server. The data can be seen immediately in real time via a mobile application. In the web application, you can view the historical data in the form of graphs, and you can also set the limit values of the parameters. If the monitored component reaches this limit, the system sends an alarm to the operator of the machine. The positioning of the sensors is ensured by strong neodymium magnets. As a result, they can be very easily placed in any area to be examined.
We would like to expand our knowledge of the system with vibration diagnostics. This is how the negotiation with the specialists of János Neumann University began. The specialists of the University and the team of Agrosentinels Ltd. discussed how, with the help of artificial intelligence, the system should be able to determine when the given component is going to fail. However, this development would require a large company that would enable the installation of an easy-to-use, affordable (a fraction of competing diagnostic systems), innovative remote monitoring system in its machines.
The system has Hungarian and European patents. In 2022, the Hungarian Innovation Association rewarded it as a successful innovation.",Debrecen,"Predictive maintenance, AI, Industry, Agtech, Precision agriculture",No funding announced yet,2022,https://agrosentinels.com/en/home/,Active,,HU

Babyndex,https://www.eu-startups.com/directory/babyndex/,Hungary,"Babyndex, the first revolutionary saliva ovulation test app can multiply pregnancy chances 3-5 times compared to conventional ovulation tests.","Two days before ovulation, the chances of pregnancy are 3-5 times higher than on the day of ovulation itself (Wilcox, 1998, [source](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9557845/); Stanford & Dunson, 2007, [source](https://academic.oup.com/aje/article/165/9/1088/90537?login=false)).
Only cervical mucus, and saliva home-use tests can pinpoint these days in real-time. The most common conventional LH urine tests pinpoint the day of ovulation. However, it takes hours for LH to appear in urine and additional hours to be detected, leading many couples to time intercourse to the day of ovulation and miss their most fertile days.
Cervical mucus is an analogue test, while saliva ovulation test is also analogue but FDA approved and widely used for detecting the most fertile days from saliva ferning (i.e. fern-shaped saliva crystals) ([FDA](https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/home-use-tests/ovulation-saliva-test)).
Babyndex is first AI-assisted mobile app that can detect saliva crystals. It is designed to aid women in identifying their peak fertile days prior to ovulation in real-time and it can help couples optimize their chances of getting pregnant ([Babyndex](https://www.babyndex.eu/en/)).

The Other WorkSpace,https://www.eu-startups.com/directory/the-other-workspace/,Hungary,"The Other WorkSpace is a coworking space in Budapest, Hungary. 

At The Other WorkSpace we focus on creating an environment that helps our members to get tasks off their to-do list. We do this by doing everything we can to make our workspace calm, comfortable, and cosy.

There is nothing wrong with a coworking place being a chill, laid-back, café-like place. And while we try to create a different environment, concentrating on helping members focus on their work, we enjoy a bit of chilling and cosy space too!","I worked a lot both from home, and from cafés. And why would I ever even want to leave my comfy home to work from somewhere else?
As the days, weeks, and months passed, I started feeling more and more like in a (admittedly quite nice) prison cell, more like in my cosy home. So I thought to myself, let's go to a coworking office! There’s plenty in the city and I'll probably be more productive there, and meet some nice people!
I went. I went and went and went and went. To a ton of places. I was a “digital nomad” (hate the word though) for a while and this lead me to go to a ton of places both in Hungary and abroad. 
There are a ton of different coworking offices, and I tried a lot of them out. Many of them were actually great to work from! Meeting with new people, going to work in a cosy place that has coffee, what more could I ask for?
Now that I settled in Budapest, the thing is that while overall the experience in some places is quite nice, and I really liked many of the coworking places I went to, I was feeling like there was something missing. 
After going to these coworking spaces, they started to feel more like cafés than a place where I could actually focus on my work. 
Initially I went to work from a coworking office because I wanted to be somewhere where I could focus on my work more than at home.
While the coworking places where I stayed for a bit of time started feeling like super cosy coffee shops where you gather with friends all day long, it wasn’t really fulfilling the goal I had initially set out for myself.
I wanted to go someplace where I would have a bit less noise, where I could focus more on my tasks, and get the work done more efficiently, so that later on I would enjoy meeting friends away from my work desk, and not have a to-do list getting longer by the day hanging over my head.
And this is why we opened our little coworking space, The Other WorkSpace in Budapest, less than a 2 minutes walk from the Lehet tér metro station on line 3. 
This way, anyone working from The Other WorkSpace can focus on getting tasks off their to-do list, and be able to work without losing track of the tasks they work on, all the while being in a comfortable and cosy environment. 
I am still going out to work from coffee shops once in a while, when I feel like it, but I know that I’ll always have my spot at The Other WorkSpace, in case I need to get some work done!",Budapest,"coworking, közösségi iroda, coworking space, comfort",,2019,https://theotherworkspace.com,,,HU
