IOVuo Oy,https://www.eu-startups.com/directory/iovuo-oy/,Finland,"IOVuo Oy is a Helsinki-based deep tech startup specializing in precision location monitoring and structural movement analysis. The name “IOVuo” is derived from “I/O” (Input and Output) and “Vuo” (Flow in Finnish), reflecting the company’s focus on data flow and innovation. Initially, IOVuo developed a precise location system using GNSS technology, achieving higher accuracy. Their first solution, a berthing aid system, was tested in collaboration with Pertamina at the Tanjung Priok Fuel Terminal. This system addresses a significant challenge for large tanker vessels during docking, providing real-time data on distance, speed, and angle to improve safety and prevent accidents like jetty damage.

Following the success of the pilot, IOVuo expanded its offerings to include a structural deformation monitoring system, designed to track movement in structures such as jetties. Pertamina engaged IOVuo for a paid pilot project at the Biak Fuel Terminal, where the system successfully monitored jetty deformation in real-time. This solution enables continuous monitoring, providing critical data that helps prevent structural failures.

Currently, IOVuo is conducting a feasibility study on buoy mooring monitoring. They aim to address gaps in existing technologies for buoy inspection and maintenance by developing sensors connected via satellite networks, crucial for remote areas without internet connectivity. This product is expected to launch in 2025.

To scale these innovations, IOVuo is seeking funding to advance the development of its products to an industrial-grade level, accelerating their go-to-market strategy for all three solutions.",Helsinki,"Deep tech, Satellite-Connected IoT, Precision Monitoring Technology",Between €1-€100K,2022,www.iovuo.com,Active,https://www.linkedin.com/company/iovuo,FI,"Business Model Overview
At its core, IOVuo operates under a B2B (Business-to-Business) model, offering innovative solutions to industries like maritime, oil & gas, and infrastructure management. Their model combines paid pilot projects, partnerships, and long-term service contracts, creating a sustainable revenue stream while driving continuous innovation. The company’s solutions are aimed at high-risk, high-value operations where precision and real-time data are essential to prevent costly accidents and improve operational efficiency.
Key Components of IOVuo’s Business Model
1.	Product Development through Pilot Projects
IOVuo’s first two products were developed in close collaboration with a key partner, Pertamina, Indonesia’s largest oil and gas company. By securing paid pilot projects, IOVuo not only validated their technology but also demonstrated immediate value to industry leaders. This approach minimizes upfront costs for development while ensuring that the product aligns with real-world needs.
2.	Focus on High-Value Industries
IOVuo targets industries where the cost of failure is significant—such as maritime, oil & gas, and infrastructure. By focusing on real-time monitoring solutions that enhance safety and operational efficiency, IOVuo offers a strong value proposition. Their solutions help clients avoid accidents, reduce downtime, and manage assets more effectively, making their services essential rather than optional.
3.	Partnership-Driven Growth
IOVuo’s business model is heavily partnership-driven. Instead of investing heavily in building their own infrastructure or workforce, they work closely with development partners, sales partners, and implementation partners. These partnerships allow IOVuo to focus on their core strength—product innovation—while leveraging their partners’ expertise for development and market entry.
Additionally, IOVuo has partnered with satellite providers to develop a satellite-connected modem for their buoy mooring monitoring solution. This partnership is key to ensuring that the product can be used in remote areas without traditional network coverage, providing a competitive edge in the market.
4.	Data as a Service (DaaS)
A major revenue stream for IOVuo comes from offering Data as a Service (DaaS). Their monitoring systems generate valuable real-time data, which is provided to clients on a subscription basis. This not only creates recurring revenue but also builds long-term relationships with clients who rely on IOVuo’s data for operational decision-making. For instance, the real-time data provided by their structural deformation system allows port operators to monitor jetty conditions constantly, enabling predictive maintenance and reducing downtime.
5.	Scalability and Product Customization
IOVuo’s solutions are designed to be scalable and adaptable across different industries. For example, while the berthing aid system was initially designed for tanker ships, its core technology can be adapted for use in other types of vessels or maritime operations. Similarly, the structural monitoring system can be applied to other critical infrastructure like bridges or towers. This adaptability makes their solutions highly scalable, both in terms of geography and industry application.
6.	Future Products and Expansion
Currently, IOVuo is conducting a feasibility study on buoy mooring monitoring, addressing another significant gap in the maritime industry. By partnering with satellite providers, IOVuo is developing a solution that can operate in remote locations without cellular network coverage. This product is set to launch in 2025, adding to IOVuo’s growing portfolio of monitoring solutions.
As part of their growth strategy, IOVuo is seeking funding to accelerate the development of these products from prototype to industrial-grade solutions, with plans to enter the market in multiple regions beyond Finland and Indonesia."

This type of customer misbehavior leads to the situation where carsharing-segment has to close service and for public transport-segment, it causes extra costs.
The attractiveness of public transport is too low and graffiti removal causes delays and costs millions of dollars.
Also, Autolib in Paris closed their carsharing service due to a large amount of damage to vehicles and high maintenance costs.
AIVisionEye has developed the state of art Travel Clean & Fresh solution for shared mobility, which combines the following two systems.
Travel Clean & Fresh consists of a wide-angle camera unit and an odor detector installed on the ceiling of the vehicle.
The camera captures pictures of the interior and an odor detector sweeps the car for suspicious odors. The data is sent to a remote server via the vehicle’s WIFI or 4G connection.
The captured data is processed with machine learning algorithms, which evaluate whether the passengers have left trash or valuables inside. Also, events of vandalism and misbehavior are analyzed.
After processing, the resulting information and alerts are generated automatically to the vehicle operator’s maintenance systems or any other 3rd party applications if maintenance or cleaning services are needed.

Behind VALO Hotel & Work is the story of an entrepreneur who travels a lot for work and could not understand why the same space could not be better utilized and used for more purposes. Traveling between the hotel and the coworking spaces seemed particularly pointless, knowing that both buildings were emptied alternately; why couldn’t everyone be in the same building around the clock?
VALO may look like an ordinary hotel or a modern coworking space, but thanks to its innovative facilities and services, it corrects big societal problems. The properties cover a significant part of Finland’s emissions, and in 2018, vacant business premises alone caused 42 thousand tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions. Even full offices, business premises, and hotels are only in operation part of the day and the rest are empty.
VALO brings together a hotel and business premises that use the same facilities at different times, depending on what customers need. The end result is a service that is always in use.

ability to independent load, transport and unload diverse cargo from any ground level space to another by any vehicle or mobile robot fully autonomously and realized the system level solution based on ’The Least Common Denominators'.
The CONTAI solution base on modules: AN OEM cargo vehicle/robot, Electric Loader, Load carrier with IoT, cargo application, such as container, recycle bin, equipment and event facility. 
The freedom to utilize any space on street level for un|loading any goods by any smart vehicle provides unprecedented opportunities for efficient and diverse last-foot city logistics.
Modularity and support for legacy components enable and encourage a smooth transition to smart implementations and processes without wasting existing assets.",Sastamala,autonomous lastmile container diversity,No funding announced yet,2019,https://www.contai.eu,,,FI,"The versatile and resilient solution for diverse and future-proof last mile needs is based on the principle of 'The Least Common Denominator'.
Once we find a minimum set of common principles, we can build a common and federative logistics ecosystem in the same way that a sea container made global supply chain true a long time ago!
Then, once the principles are discovered and implemented citizens will see the delivery of qoods already automatically sorted and bundled into encapsulated containers, mobile lockers and refrigerated boxes being brought into ground level city hubs. Smart encapsulated cargo units could then be loaded with little effort into the most suitable last mile vehicles, taking into account cargo dimensions,  mileage, weather and available resources when allocating a right vehicle. Some of units could make door-to-door deliveries carried by the vehicles and robots, and after that or directly dropped on curbside or any available space in the city space. When the last mile is not enough, wheeled units could be pushed indoors and back. 
Immaterial no-cost city hubs on plain ground would allow them to be redimensioned and relocated, thus optimizing the last mile network.
The freedom to utilize any space on street level for un|loading any goods by any smart vehicle provides unprecedented opportunities for efficient and diverse last-foot city logistics.
The challenge and danger of that kind of harmonization approach is that we fail and define too tight rules that will limit the system to certain types of vehicles and goods, allow only one size of cargo containers, only support new technology, reject old and current investments, favor only large players and bind the customer for years to one specific technology by one provider. We are really afraid of the day when the project by name 'The last mile bicycle container standard' has been funded!
- The two words Last Mile have almost become synonymous with parcel delivery, which means a certain type, size and weight of goods and which is mostly transported by electric-assisted cargo bikes. Who is interested in urban logistics and service needs as a whole and vehicles with broader capabilities? Why don’t electric cars have pedals if the muscular power of workers 55 and older have to help electric propulsion?
Note that this is not intended to counter award-winning and sustainable cargo bikes, but is meant to bring thinking beyond the pedals to find a holistic strategy and realize a system level solution to cover all goods, vehicles. equipment and services, including the autonomomy with mobile robots, that are about to enter the cities. 
 The state-of-art autonomous industrial robots need docking stations in both end for loading and unloading. In addition, none of the current last mile container vehicles cannot load or unload cargo autonomously but guided and pushed by a person and the container has a rather small, fixed size. These solutions and investments are or are becoming obsolete or incompatible in autonomous last mile logistics.
We really need one common physical platform as vital part of the physical internet that supports federative way the mobility of diverse cargo, storage and machinery, support for collaboration, module sharing and automation in packing, sorting, loading and unloading provided by mobile robots alongside legacy assets.
THE LEAST COMMON DENOMINATOR
CONTAI has a system level answer to the last mile challenge: “The Least Common Denominator”.
We need and now we have one resilient candidate for the last mile ecosystem standard. It splits in two:
Physical part: The interface definition for the wheeled universal Load Carrier to support operations on the plain ground; loading, unloading, parking, automatic lashing and the second interface to connect applications to the Load Carrier: cargo boxes, mobile lockers, machinery, sanitary facilities, etc. 
Digital part: The interface definition for the IoT interface, i.e. minimum information about the identity and location of the load carrier that serves fleet management and independent docking, loading and parking. Note that vehicles and applications may have their own IoT. 
The core of the CONTAI platform is the smart interfaces of the Load Carrier enabling a wide range of logistics services connecting resources and parties. Everything is wrapped around the Load Carrier! - The sea container and the EUR pallet have similar objectives and functions.
One important target and support provided by the Load Carrier’s interfaces is the autonomous loading and unloading capability. CONTAI has developed an automatic Loader that can automatically load the Load Carrier onto a vehicle equipped with the Loader. A CONTAI Loader can fully autonomously load a CONTAI Load Carrier from plain ground and street and safety leave it on the street without any docks or other auxiliaries. This is important and unique in the world! The whole process of docking-loading-lashing-transferring-unloading-parking performed by a mobile robot can be autonomous on SAE level 4, but the technology also supports the parallel use of traditional vehicles such as cargo trikes and quads, scooters and vans. As autonomy is particularly important to secure a continuum for an autonomous future, special attention has been paid to deviation-tolerant docking. 
The development of last mile logistics is not only searching for suitable vehicles and routes but improvement of all process steps such as sorting, packaging and multimodal transfer of cargo from one vehicle to another and more. A ground-level city hub with scarce facilities relocates  scales and multiplies quickly on demand basis. City events, city calendar, weather, citizen behavior, BigData, AI and the demand can steer the hub and mobile locker swarm placement and size. A sparsely facilitated ground-level hub is possible if cargo units can be loaded and unloaded directly at ground level, such as with the CONTAI technology integrated into OEM cargo vehicles. The ability to unload any cargo at any free ground level destination spot makes the CONTAI system resilient and effective.
Modularity and support for legacy components enable and encourage a smooth transition to smart implementations and processes without wasting existing assets.

CONTAI VALUE PROPOSITIONS
'AnyCargo, AnyPlace, AnyVehicle, AnyMile, AnyOperator, evenAutonomously'
- AnyCargo – Any size and any kind of applications and equipment can be fastened to LoadCarriers. The cargo width is limited just by the vehicle characteristics, such as 0.7-2.6 m. The length of app/cargo is 0.7-3,0 m, max payload is limited by the vehicle capacity and the weight class of the Loader, e.g. 250 ... 1000 kg.
- AnyVehicle – Exisiting and new cargo vehicles and mobile robots with free space on front or back can potentially be utilized.
- AnySpace – Ground / street–level spaces can be used in both end of the transport for un|loading and storage.
- AnyMile – Because the Loader can be installed on many OEM cargo vehicle with different characteristics, congested delivery points, long-distance suburban and rural areas can be optimally served even in challenging conditions.
- AnyOperator – Demountable cargo and utility applications with alternative vehicles allow services to be performed by different actors.
- evenAutonomously – The Loader supports autonomous LoadCarrier docking, loading, lashing, transport, unloading and parking. Unmanned cargo vehicles combined with the autonomous cargo handling can perform fully autonomous services.
CONTAI IPR
CONTAI IPR asset is not intended to prevent the shared introduction of new technology that will benefit humanity, but to coordinate the integrity of the CONTAI Least Common Denominator and make the business fair.

Clewat Oy,https://www.eu-startups.com/directory/clewat-oy/,Finland,"Clewat is an innovative growth company registered in Finland that makes environmental solutions based on an innovative patent-pending flow-management approach. The company manufactures and operates solutions related to removal of harmful water plants and algae, marine plastic, oil and chemical spills, environmentally sustainable melting of snow and air purification.",Kokkola,"oceanplastic, saving the seas,  oil spill response",No funding announced yet,2018,www.clewat.com,,,FI,"Clewat’s mission is a clean, plastic-free sea with the help of a sea cleaning vessel developed by the Chief innovator Johannes Myllykoski. After the oil disaster in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010 Myllykoski realized that there are still not good enough solutions to tackle the environmental problems of the sea. But Myllykoski wanted to make a difference so he started working on a device which could collect oil properly.
During the first years of the device’s development, Myllykoski realized that,with the same amount of effort, he could make a device that would also collect plastic waste from the sea. He found out that by utilizing the water flow, it is possible to find a solution that would effectively improve both serious problems.
The device did not come easy. Myllykoski has devoted thousands of hours to developing it. However, a small prototype has grown in less than ten years, a device that is already operational in seas, rivers, lakes, and harbor pools. Clewat company was founded in 2018 by Johannes Myllykoski. The company originated in Kokkola, Finland where the vessels are still made.
Clewat’s goals are high and they are supposed to be achieved quickly. The first devices have been on the seas in the spring of 2019 and Clewat’s goal is that two years from now, 20 of Cleansweep-vessels will clean the oceans.
Clewat – For a cleaner environment
In the removal of water-based nuisances the company currently produces 3rd generation cleaning vessels, i.e. Clewat Cleansweep -series. That particular vessel type has been operated by Clewat in more than half-a-dozen-countries with excellent results. The Cleansweep-solution has won the Ålandsbanken Baltic Sea award for the most important innovation in 2018. Additionally, the development and piloting work has been supported by the government of Finland, and the vessel's cleaning work has been commissioned by various governmental and private organizations.
Clewat's innovation is one of the most effective solutions to marine environmental problems today. Innovation is based on exploiting the flow of water, which allows high power to be achieved with a small amount of energy. The vessel collects plastic, oil and harmful vegetation with the booms at the front, where the water flow is regulated so that various debris and impurities enter the ship's conveyor and then sorted into tanks.
Cleansweep is highly scalable, since by adjusting the length of the booms, the width of the area to be treated can be increased up to more than a kilometer. The vessel is capable of collecting down to half a millimeter sized particles. Cleansweep vessels are currently seven meters long and two meters wide, which is approximately the size of a container, so that it can be easily transported around the world.
Even a single Cleansweep vessel can collect more than 200 cubic meters of garbage and harmful vegetation per hour. Flow-based technology does not cause mechanical stress to watercourses and has no negative environmental impact. Concerning oil spills, Transport Canada estimates that in a"

Competitors 
Google Scholar  is the default place where people go to search for any academic information. They have advantage internet supremacy, but most researchers turn to subject specific data sources when they need to get highly specific information.  Also google scholar is  a by-product of giant search engines naturally it presents only popular hits. But researchers want more relevant and highly specific data. That’s where ZEALBOTS’s personalized data delivery can help.   
ResearchGate is more like a social media platform for researchers with 17 million users. They are attractive for Q/A and social validation of researchers' lives. Still it lacks any advanced search or other research related tools. 
Strategy 
Subscription based recurrent revenue from end-users
SaaS subscription for institutions On-cloud / On-premises
Collective licences for research groups
Ad revenue from free user web / desktop / mobile app
Affiliate sales or books / chemicals / devices
Sales cycle.
Subscription sales for end-users is completely automated. Through academic conferences, ad campaigns and referrals we can establish growth.

In Finland, the game is known as Ekapeli, and is played in all pre- and primary schools with fantastic results. Governments, foundations and research institutes have spent over 100M€ in the neuropsychological research whilst developing the game methodology. It is a highly researched game with over 300 research papers in different contexts. Following its success in Finland, GraphoGame has been contextualised in collaboration with local universities into multiple languages including English, French, Swahili, Chinese, Spanish and Portuguese. According to research by the University of Cambridge Centre for Centre for Neuroscience in Education which has co-developed the English version of the game, GraphoGame is as ‘effective as one-to-one teacher support in achieving basic literacy skills’.
The game allows the player gradually move from graphemes and phonemes through syllables and rhyme units, to eventually learn how to blend what they have learned into complete words.
GraphoGame adapts to the player skill levels through learning algorithms and provides actionable learning analytics for parents and teachers to facilitate intervention.
It has in-game rewards to push students to excel and be incentivised to learn.

Get Mezzanine Financing,https://www.eu-startups.com/directory/get-mezzanine-financing/,Finland,"Get Mezzanine Financing is all about helping business leaders obtain mezzanine financing for their companies.

Mezzanine financing is a type of capital that has some of the characteristics of bank loans and some of owners share capital.

Typically it is structured as a loan, though in such a way that it doesnt make primary lenders (that is banks) uncomfortable. This is achieved through often very low  cost of servicing that loan during the early years of the financing. Specifically, this means little or no principal repayments, as well as interest payments.

During that period the company taking on mezzanine capital is expected to grow or, at least, improve its cash flow generating ability and also equity value.

The mezzanine financing firms expect to eventually earn from the interest that is paid later on and, often, participate in some way in the shareholder benefits resulting from the increase in the company value.

GetMezzanineFinancing.com not only clarifies the whole concept of this specialized form of financing, but it also helps companies looking for mezzanine capital to find the right partners that can provide such funds.

Mezzanine financing is especially attractive for middle-market companies, which have limited access to both public debt markets and bank financing. Besides, this form of financing results in very little dilution to the existing shareholders.

Furthermore, mezzanine capital is also widely utilized in private equity sponsored transactions to allow for higher levels of debt.",Espoo,"financing, capital, lender",,2015,http://www.getmezzaninefinancing.com,,,FI,
