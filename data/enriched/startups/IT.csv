Each cube is a geolocated container where anyone can create one or more Cube Domains, digital spaces that can host multimedia content such as videos, audio, images, documents, and much more.
Thousands of Cube Domains, owned by different people, can coexist within a single cube, creating a unique layering of data in the real world.
In the future, Cube Domains within each cube will be organized based on content quality, thanks to a merit-based system that will highlight the relevance, usefulness, and impact of each Cube Domain.
Who is it for? Cubish is an open, general-purpose system, just like the web once was.
""The cube will relate to Cube Domains like a search engine relates to web domains.""
With one fundamental difference: Cube Domains are anchored to real-world coordinates and can be expanded into other cubes through expansions, across entire areas, squares, shops, buildings, public or private spaces, even far apart from each other.
Each expansion of a Cube Domain can host different content based on its location, shaping a distributed, geolocated digital network.
""It's like taking a web domain and spreading it across the real world.""
Today, it starts with data. Tomorrow, immersive technologies will be integrated.
Cubish paves the way for the coexistence of digital and immersive realities, layered onto physical spaces.

 forecasting algorithm based on geospatial and meteorological data, PuntoMare provides ultra-local forecasts for
 each beach, enabling visitors to plan their days optimally. The nature of the algorithm allows it to be patented as
 a process.
 Additionally, the integration of an AI Agent, named ""Punto,"" provides personalized assistance, answering
 questions and offering recommendations like a local tour guide.
 PuntoMare differentiates itself from competitors through a unique combination of advanced technologies and
 strategic focus: while existing platforms primarily concentrate on customer acquisition before arrival (destination
 marketing), PuntoMare focuses on proximity marketing and post-arrival engagement, delivering added value to
 both tourists and local operators.
 The business model includes both a B2C component, represented by a transaction commission on bookings made
 for beach facilities, rentals, experiences, and restaurants (partnered through affiliate programs with Spiagge.it,
 Viator, Musement, and Quandoo), and a B2B component, based on advertising sales and data monetization.
 The multidisciplinary team is one of the key pillars of Mnsimu Srls’s success. Professionals with complementary
 expertise in technology, commerce, and finance work synergistically to realize the company’s mission.""",Muro Leccese,"Marine Forecasts, Eco Friendly Tourism, Digital Beach Experience",Between €100K-€500K,2023,https://www.punto-mare.it/,IT,,Active,https://www.linkedin.com/company/puntomare/

If a test fails due to a bug in your code, it provides a detailed explanation of where the bug is. Super fast fixing!
If a test needs to be updated since your code changed, it writes an updated test and opens a new Pull Request.
If a test is not covering enough edge cases, or does not exist at all, CodeBeaver writes it and opens a new Pull Request

What about security?
We take the security of your codebase very seriously. We are GDPR and SOC2 compliant. Learn more on our security page.
Frequently asked questions
Wait, won't it commit tests that pass for buggy code?
No. This is because CodeBeaver will write tests based on its understanding of how your function should work, not based on how you implemented it.
For CodeBeaver to have an understanding of your requirements, it's usually enough to write comments at the start of your function describing what it should do. You can check out this Pull Request to see it in action.
I like to write Unit Tests! Does this mean I don't need them anymore?
We like writing Unit Tests as much as you do! CodeBeaver will run and maintain existing tests, as well as extend the ones it finds. So you can go on and write Unit Tests, but you don't have to worry about covering all of the edge cases and all of the functions if you feel like it.
Which LLM models do you use?
We use Claude 3.5 Sonnet by Anthropic for agentic tasks and O3-mini from OpenAI for code generation. They are both GDPR and SOC 2 compliant.
What languages & frameworks do you support?

Product highlights:
We empower business participation in the fight against climate change. Our technology connects companies with planters to measure, monitor and verify nature-based investments like carbon removal.
Measure
Our trees are equipped with RFID tags to identify the plant’s information and collect its data. We then install smart sensors among networks of trees to monitor air quality and plot health in real time. Together, these systems provide an accurate measurement of how much carbon is removed by each tree.
Monitor
A digital avatar is then created for each tree and linked to the plant’s data source in the field. We use the data from our field systems to quantify each plant’s CO2 removal. Clients can view and manage this data through our simple user dashboard.
Verify
Carbon removal certificates are issued based on the tons of CO2 stored in each tree, and each tree’s data is transferred to the blockchain. This provides an unalterable permanent record for each tree and makes it traceable, thus neutralizing problems related to double-counting emissions.
Product Benefits:
We provide independent and unbiased data provided directly from the field that is accurately and transparently tracked and attributed to relevant stakeholders in a way that enables liabilities and benefits to be correctly identified, valued and managed.
End-to-End
End-to-end carbon removal and verification. We partner with planters to ensure that only the highest quality removals make it onto our platform, and we manage the process every step of the way.
Live Data
Live data on how much carbon is removed by your trees. This data is easy-to-access and can be shared publicly with your investors, employees and customers via the 17tons platform or through our simple APIs.

All RE49 collections are limited editions, made with the circular economy model, traceable through the Blockchain, and PETA approved vegan. The materials we use in our atelier are at the center of our vision of progress. Their stories inspire the creativity of our artisans: forgotten beach deckchairs and umbrellas of long summers spent on the Riviera become our Mare sneakers, worn-out spinnakers that sailed through Mediterranean waves are reborn in our Sail collection, denim and other waste fabrics are converted into the Jeans and Fabric collections. The style of our shoes is a fusion of casual streetwear and urban chic elements, with a touch of rock in the Spin Tech collection.
We do not fear the passing of time, and we believe in continuity and the infinite ability to reinvent ourselves and our world.

This sharply reduces the possibility of the formation of hazardous substances such as dioxins, furans, NOx and SOx. This technology makes it possible to obtain zero emissions into the environment through waste processing.

During this process, dusts and toxic gases are transformed into completely environment friendly components according to U.S. EPA and EU EEA regulation.

Using the most advanced technologies, Artificial Intelligence and its own algorithms protected by international patents, TrueScreen analyzes the acquired content, verifying its non-alteration with respect to the original source, altogether with other characteristics related to the acquisition. If the outcome of all these checks is positive, the App delivers a 100% compliant forensic report that can be immediately shared in order to prove that the information is fully trustable. The document is therefore digitally signed, time stamped (by our partner Intesa by IBM, an accredited certification body) and completed with all the technical parameters which are useful to define the context in which the acquisition took place, in accordance with the main international directives in the field of digital preservation.
TrueScreen's goal is to provide anyone with an accessible and technologically advanced tool, becoming a fundamental support in the process of collection of digital evidence in various fields (civil, criminal, administrative and extrajudicial), be that in defense of personal rights (such as cyber-bullying, revenge porn, stalking, online defamation, etc ..) or more broadly to certify an event that may have legal or extra judicial consequences (ex. assessing state of conservation of furniture and buildings, industrial inspections, car accidents etc ..).
TrueScreen has been developed by addressing one main issue: it is increasingly easier to modify all Media content with the aim of manipulating reality. This current high volatility of the online information requires the presence of tools that could crystallize the acquisition of a Media, that is to lock the data around an image or video. By doing so, such a solution carries along the extreme probative value of the information that each user may need to archive for future proof.
This solution integrates specific features both for the B2C world (non-professional users) and for the B2B ecosystem (lawyers and other forensic professionals, professional firms, technical firms, private companies, insurance companies, banks, associations, public administration, utilities and other realities), being this an  useful tool not only to certify the acquisition of contents but above all to safely manage the entire flow of documents.",,

Innovative nanocoating that is able to produce electric energy from heated surfaces (also from the sun). It produces electricity from thermal differential effect and needs two surfaces at two different temperatures.The coating is transparent, based on nano-particles, and can be easily applied to many materials",MILANO,"coating, electric energy, heated surfaces",Between €1 million-€ 2.5 million,2020,WWW.STARTEF.COM,IT,"STARTEF srl has developed an innovative coating that is able to produce electric energy from heated surfaces (also from the sun). In detail the nanocoating produces electricity from thermal differential (Seebeck/Peltier) effect and needs two surfaces at two differenti temperatures.The coating is transparent, based on nano-particles, and can be easily applied to:
glass windows and doors: the nanocoating, being a transparent thermal conductor, turns out to be completely safe if applied to these materials, transforming the windows into real electricity generators exploiting the difference between the inner and outer surfaces of the glass ;
photovoltaic modules: the efficiency of commercial photovoltaic panels does not exceed 20% due to overheating problems. With the application on a photovoltaic panel of this coating, the EDT- layer does not affect the conversion of light into electricity, given the transparency of the layer itself, and also manages to cool the panel by increasing its efficiency to 40% and producing electricity using the subtracted heat;
Insulation modules for thermal coats: These modules are used as external or internal covering of buildings and apartments to increase their energy efficiency and reduce heat loss. If the surface of these panels were coated with EDT, the difference in temperature between the inside of the house and the outside could be exploited to produce electricity, in addition, by converting the heat into electricity, it prevents the passage between inside and outside, thus improving thermal insulation;
Customized support for energy recovery at an industrial level: large industries are increasingly interested in energy saving and are increasingly adopting solutions that allow them to use energy at a lower cost. Covering metal panels with EDT-layers, in order to create customizable modular structures capable of capturing heat and converting it into electricity, could lead these companies to self-produce part of the electricity required at a very competitive price.
With the creation of the smart window as well as having a system capable of producing energy from the thermal differential (external and internal temperature), inserted in a domotic system it can act as an alarm system, since EDT is a thermal detector. It can also detect anomalous presences of people, for surveillance and security.
The The SME is open for collaboration with companies, research centres and universities for partnering in research projects.
Moreover, preferred partners are private companies for the following cooperations:
license agreement: licensing for the use of the application;
commercial agreement with technical assistance: the partner should provide to the company all the information about its requirements in order the company to set up a customized product
partening in collaborative research funded projects
Advantages & innovations
The advantages of the EDT-nanotechnology coatings are:
energy saving and energy efficiency
improvement of environmental climate sustainability ra
tional use of renewable energy sources,
implementation with safety and transport systems,
efficiency improvement in smart agriculture,
smart mobility, smart cities sectors, ships, trains, aerospace systems.
All customers falling into these categories can take advantage of EDT technology to increase the added value of their products, make them more efficient and competitive within a global business landscape. The practical energy saving solution, at low cost, does not request for aesthetic changes or spaces suitable for installations. As for an exemplum: a coating of about 1800 nanometers is transparent at visible ligth between 380-750 nanometers and with a temperature difference of 10 °C is able to produce 550W/square meter.",,

However, exclusive reliance on protocols and periodic monitoring is expensive, inefficient, and can hinder or slow down access to care.
Currently, the healthcare system still predominantly uses hybrid systems, paper-based and digital, without a real digital transformation. Moreover, there is a lack of interactive follow-up with patients and long waiting lines generate inefficiencies and delays in healthcare management. Furthermore, the lack of remote monitoring equipment represents a costly and unportable limit. The system still heavily relies on the human component (bias&errors). Consider the emergency room, where up to 50% of routine hospitalizations take place, and where up to 1 in 7 accidents resulting from improper or delayed diagnosis have led to fatalities.
Our system monitors a high number of patients in real-time, predicts clinical risk, and enhances the efficiency of medical work. It functions as a decision support tool, saving human lives, and reducing workload to improve their psychophysical well-being. The CLS platform will classify patients based on their real-time care needs, providing physicians with support for patient management. Moreover, the creation of a patient-centric medical system aims to anticipate clinical risk by using AI.
The creation of a patient-centric medical system aims to anticipate clinical risk by using artificial intelligence algorithms to improve healthcare effectiveness.

Connect to someone who has the app, connect Bluetooth headphones, put the phone in your pocket and you can have a conversation as if the other person spoke your language.
The main feature of RTranslator is the Conversation mode. In this mode, you can connect with another phone that uses this app. If the user accepts your connection request:
- When you talk, your phone (or the Bluetooth headset, if connected) will capture the audio.
- The audio captured will be converted into text and sent to the interlocutor's phone.
- The interlocutors' phone will translate the text received into his language.
- The interlocutors' phone will convert the translated text into audio and will reproduce it from its speaker (or by the Bluetooth headset of the interlocutor, if connected to his phone).
All this in both directions.
Each user can have more than one interlocutor so that you can translate conversations between more than two people and in any combination.
Both translation and speech recognition use Google's APIs to ensure the best possible quality.
Also, RTranslator works even in the background, with the phone on standby or when using other apps (only when you use Conversation or WalkieTalkie modes).
To use this app, you have to configure it. Also, the Google APIs on which the app is based are not free. When you create your account for the first time, you have a $ 300 voucher valid for one year, but after that, the APIs will no longer be free.

The use of 3D printing models in dental offices is nowadays crucial in the communication between patients and dentists, making the planning of the treatment easier and increasing the satisfaction. Also the use of the model makes it easier for the dentist to plan the intervention, avoiding to directly plan it in the patient's mouth and decreasing discomfort. Last but not least, the 3D models can be very useful in seminars and lessons, where normally are used standardised models that don't really reflect a real patient's situation. Oral3D offers a unique solution, made by 3D printer and software, the only one existing capable of directly translating a CT Scan into a STL file, ready to print. Normally it takes technical help, money and time for a dentist to translate a CT Scan into a printable model, Oral3D's software does it automatically in a few minutes.",Rome,"3D Printing, Dental, Education, Health Care, Medical Device, Software",No funding announced yet,2019,https://www.oral3d.eu/en/,IT,,,

ZENATI AUTOMOBILI,https://www.eu-startups.com/directory/zenati-automobili/,Italy,"Zenati Automobili is a company born of a passion for cars and technology. We are building the first hypercar supported by technological innovation

The passion for the automotive and design sector pushed Gianpiero Zenati to devise an innovative and hyper-technological hypercar. Both the interior and exterior of the car are designed to make its forms harmonious, sinuous and faithful to the made in Italy design. The ambitious project required several months of gestation to define the main strengths of the product and what will be the optimal path to penetrate the reference sector.

A careful market analysis has been carried out (from the point of view of supply and demand).
The analysis of the offer focused on the 24 main hypercar manufacturers, as well as potential competitors of the future Zenati company. The strengths that have enabled them to establish themselves and the development trends of the sector have been studied.

It has been found that the technological evolution and development of hybrid cars is pushing many of the analyzed companies (see for example Porsche and McLaren) to develop models of hypercars with hybrid engines.
The costs for the development of the products in question are significant and justify the high selling price, which often exceeds € 1 million and sometimes even € 2 million if customizations offered by production companies are included.

The demand analysis identified potential customers among the Ultra High Networth Individuals, that is, individuals with net assets in excess of € 30 million. Since the financial crisis of 2007-2009 the increase in the concentration of wealth has led to a constant growth of the members of this category, making the luxury market increasingly profitable.",Basilicata,"automotive, cars, mobility",,2019,http://www.zenatiautomobili.it/,IT,"The first model of hypercar that will be launched will have a minimum power of 700 hp, a maximum speed of over 350 km / h and acceleration from 0 to 100 km / h under 3 seconds. Furthermore, the car's main strengths will be the design and technologies implemented within it.
The realization of such an ambitious project requires a prepared team capable of understanding the corporate vision: Gianpiero Zenati will be able to count on four trust profiles that will play a key role in the startup phase. Gianmauro Pozzovivo (electronic engineer), Vincenzo Pierro (sales and marketing), Vincenzo Grieco (mechanical engineer at Ferrari SpA) will have a fundamental role in the development of the company. Further partnerships with the best universities will support Zenati in the realization, and subsequent maintenance, of its project from a technical and managerial point of view.
With regard to the marketing campaign, it is possible to divide the GANTT into two fundamental phases. During the first 3 years of life, the company will be mainly engaged in the design and development of the first prototype of the car. In this first phase, we will try to make it known to the general public by publishing articles and
presenting a first model at automotive fairs. After completing the prototype, newspaper articles will be abandoned and more will be invested in participation in international exhibitions. In this case the target will be the potential customers and, thanks also to a sales agent, it is expected to have the first order for car production.
In the following years the company will continue to produce the cars on commission until the number of copies required by the limited circulation is exhausted.
In the first 3 years of life the company will make use of engineering consultancy that will accompany the internal engineers in product development. The business model, as for many competitors operating in the sector, requires that a large part of the production is outsourced, so as to be able to significantly reduce fixed costs and consequently the business risk linked to the activity. The handicraft production of the main carbon components and the assembly of the entire car remains a strict responsibility of the company.
2 - Definition of the product
Both the interiors and the exteriors of the hypercar are studied in detail to create a product with unique performance and design. The choice of materials is well defined. The chassis, body and steering wheel will be made of carbon fiber. Dashboard and controls will be made of aluminum or steel. Extremely refined materials will embellish the interior, enhancing every detail. The distinguishing element of the latter will be the presence of LEDs, through which it will be possible to create different plays of light inside the passenger compartment, with the possibility of changing the temperature and intensity of the colors.
The line of the car explicitly recalls made in Italy through harmonious and elongated lateral lines that streamline it. The well-defined front emphasizes the sporty nature of the car, giving it an aggressive but elegant tone. In line with this idea is the minimalism of the rear-view mirrors, which respond to the aesthetic parameters without sacrificing their functionality. As for the rear of the car, two elements stand out: the lack of a spoiler, voluntarily omitted in order not to weigh down the visual image, and the pentagonal shaped exhausts. Moreover, the engine will be appreciable from the outside thanks to a panel produced with a transparent material.
The car will presumably be equipped with a V8 engine (it will eventually be possible to implement a V10 or V12), combined with an electric motor, capable of developing a maximum total power of no less than 700 horses. The natural consequence of these mechanical characteristics is the incredible performance of the hypercar that will be able to reach a maximum speed of over 350 km / h and to go from 0 to 100 km / h in less than 3 seconds. To ensure an adrenalin-free but at the same time safe driving, the automatic and sequential gearbox will play a crucial role, which with instant passage times will guarantee a competition standard, as well as the braking system composed of carbon ceramic calipers. Therefore, the implementation in the car of active aerodynamic components that increase the performance, downforce and aerodynamics of the vehicle is of fundamental importance.
A further strong point is the technological equipment of this car, starting from the starting of the engine which is allowed not only through the recognition of the key (without insertion), but also through a voice recognition system or fingerprint. This will be combined with a latest-generation infotainment system to ensure a 360-degree experience.
As evidence of the high level of technological integration that we intend to achieve, an app will be developed that allows us to monitor our car, geolocate it and obtain data and information relating to performance in real time. However, the most impactful application functionality for users will be the ability for the driver to remotely control the vehicle, using remote functions.
An important aspect for the brand is the possibility of customization. While on the one hand we aim to create a solid brand identity through a
color that can identify the Zenati brand, on the other the customer will have the opportunity to shape, on the basis of their own needs and tastes, a multiplicity of aspects and construction details. Given the high level of customization, there will never be two identical cars. These will be unique specimens, authentic works of art produced in an extremely limited edition.
Unsurprisingly, Zenati's philosophy is not based on an exclusively product-centric vision, but sees customer satisfaction as a crucial aspiration. The aim is to ensure maximum customer satisfaction through the care of both the pre-sales and post-sales phases. As for the first, we act on product customization, partnerships with financial and insurance companies to guarantee the purchaser advantageous purchase conditions, partnerships with luxury boutiques to provide a wider experience and finally partnerships with transport companies to come meeting the logistic needs of the final consumer.",,

Ecobubble,https://www.eu-startups.com/directory/ecobubble/,Italy,"Ecobubble promotes a new way to design and manage green areas (urban gardens, green roofs, agricultural land, etc.), so as to be able to optimize water management, reduce pollutants and improve the availability of good quality food in urban environments.",Italy,"Green, Blue, IoT, Smart City, Phytoremediation",,2019,www.ecobubble.it,IT,"Ecobubble promotes a new way to design and manage green areas (urban gardens, green roofs, agricultural land, etc.), so as to be able to optimize water management, reduce pollutants and improve the availability of good quality food in urban environments.
The team conceived a market solution to integrate all its knowledge in a single product called GREEN-BLUE 1 (GB1). The product is a new kind of green-blue roof that is an architectural equipment aimed at having the most efficient environmental mitigation on the market. It is developed to improve the environmental, energy and water saving performances of new Smart-Green Buildings and to facilitate an environmentally sustainable conversion of buildings.
Our GB1, through the integration of different technologies, manages to synergistically exploit the advantages of green-roofs with those of blue-roofs (roofs with special water tanks). All together, the technologies used in GB1 converge in an integrated system called Ecomotica, introducing a new type of efficient garden automation for the mitigation of local pollutants and for monitoring the maintenance of green areas both in public/private gardens.
The Green-Blue 1 consists of a green roof, a lighting system, a water collection tank, a specific garden automation system, a virtual server that processes the system forecasts and a related data monitoring app.
GB1 is presented to customers with a complete UNI 11235-15 certification of its systems, their components and performance. The team also filed two patent applications to protect the project's innovations.
The product can be schematized in three parts, GREEN, BLUE and SMART.
GREEN - Users are offered a scenographic, highly domotic green space aimed at making the plants' natural ability to clean the air and soil more efficient (optimized phytoremediation). This allows green areas to implement a real plant filtration, where the polluting agents are split from the biological activities of the plants and incorporated into their biomass.
BLUE - Ecomotica also manages automatically the water flows of the structure by rationalizing the use of water resources in order to collect as much rainwater as possible (compatibly with the plant, structural and environmental constraints) but also to make it flow efficiently when large rains are forecasted. The water management methodology regulated by software modules executed on a cloud implementation device dynamically connect the aspects related to the collection and distribution of water with those related to the maintenance of the greenery of the structures above the water reserve in order to optimize the effectiveness of maintenance and water saving. The methodology used is designed to completely reuse every mm of rain that has fallen on GB1.
SMART - GB1 is based on IoT, Machine Learning and Cloud Controls technologies, where the hardware components of the system are equipped with wireless connection and are independent elements of a network, so as to create a real ""Internet of things"".
The premise for our business purposes is to believe in the principles of equality and protection of others, offering a way of thinking and acting that manages to enhance diversity and cooperation. The team believes that precisely these principles are the sources to generate the precious insights and effective solutions required for the achievement of the ambitious and essential objectives of sustainable development.
The company is looking for foreign companies in charge of Green design, management and control of contaminants technologies and green-roof services/products interested in commercial agreements with technical assistance. The company can adapt the system to specific conditions upon request.
Advantages and Innovations
The design and the integrated garden automation system allows our solutions to have an efficient phytoremediation, a continuous targeted control on the monitored area (green, pollutants and water) and to support the decisional process thanks to a predictivity concept.
The results are an improvement in pollutants mitigation, water-saving, environmental monitoring and maintenance performances.

Docspecial,https://www.eu-startups.com/directory/docspecial/,Italy,"The idea behind ​​this portal was obtained from years of work experience of its founder in Italian hospital emergency rooms, wards, and clinics. Years spent experiencing and seeing the ever-increasing dissatisfaction and unhappiness of patients and that of his colleagues and professionals working in the field.
The increasing of fees for medical visits, longer waiting lines and the lack of doctors have led to a serious drop in the quality of our national health care system. Often forcing the upper middle class to seek alternative methods of healthcare, which are currently poorly distributed in regional areas, with high prices and imprecise accessibility to offered services, often incorrect and ineffective.
The business potential is incredibly profitable.

That is why Docspecial was created, the first free portal for medical assistance, specialist doctors and health professions.",Siena,"hospitals, healthcare",No funding announced yet,2019,www.docspecial.it,IT,"The portal aims to create a highly specialized on-demand healthcare service, 7 days a week - 24 hours a day, at first aid stations, private clinics, medical offices, professional, specialist or home offices. Docspecial functions like a large private virtual clinic. Managing, coordinating and mediating professional/facility services to patients.
The service proposal
By simply registering on the site and with 3 quick clicks, the healthcare user/patient can choose the most appropriate professional, the most suitable and/or nearby facility, the most appropriate medical exams or a home visit. All this through a very advanced and simplified search interface, which is based either on a simple search by professional name and surname, geographical area (town or city), specialization or area of expertise either by symptom or manifested illness.
We have also developed an innovative graphic research system, where potential patients will have a simple and stylized graphical representation of the human body in which they can directly interact by clicking the areas of pain, discomfort or corresponding to their ailment in an intuitive way and quickly finding a professional that is more suitable.
When a doctor or healthcare professional registers, he/she will have a personal area available. The personal page will display the general information, curriculum vitae, professional experiences, profile photo and additional images of their facility or clinic.
An agenda that is perfectly integrated with the portal and the search system for a professional. In this electronic section, you can enter your availability to perform visits and services that can be booked directly through our site without limits of schedules and days. Based on the availability inserted, the professional can be visited or not by the potential patient at the time of the research (example: if the doctor or facility inserts their availability from Monday to Friday from 09 to 19, they will be visible and geo-localized by all users/patients on the days and in the time slots inserted). The doctor can then decide whether to perform a house visit or a visit to his office, clinic or hospital. 
This function allows almost total flexibility of space and time. The agenda can be synchronized with other professional agendas, and based on the functionality of Google calendar, it will be automatically synchronized with all mobile devices used by the operator.
An essential and absolutely innovative aspect is the creation of the personal e-commerce of the doctor. Thanks to this function it will be possible to insert, in addition to the visit or basic service, offers, special and extra services (infiltration, stress ECG, diagnostic imaging, etc.) selectable and purchased directly at the time of booking. In the future, this function will allow clinics, outpatient clinics, associated offices, and private hospitals to manage visits and services of any kind in total simplicity and with considerable savings in time and personnel. In the future, the operator will be able to manage the medical records of visited patients2.

The reference scenario 
The reference framework 
The demographic changes of the Italian population, the increase in longevity, the technological evolution and new pharmaceuticals have all placed the sustainability of Italy’s National Health System at risk not only from the point of view of financial sustainability but also with respect to maintaining an adequate capacity of healthcare welfare3. Furthermore, the increasing chronicity of illnesses and the increase in the rate of dependency require for the identification of organizational and service models to effectively answer to “new” systems of healthcare.
The National Health System of Italy is demonstrating its inability to support these challenges.
As a result, the resorting to the use of private healthcare continues to grow, consolidating each year mainly through the failure to absorb the “new needs” of healthcare for citizens.
In 2018, RBM and Censis estimated that total private healthcare costs (for around 150 million healthcare services performed outside the National Health Service) were € 39.7 billion 4.
This total is constantly expanding (+ 9.6% between 2013 and 2017) and concerns over 44.1 million people (more than 2 out of 3), with an average disbursement of 655 euros per citizen. 
3 Extract from the VIII Report RBM - Censis on Public, Private and Intermediary Healthcare.
4 Based on the latest ISTAT data for 2017, the Private Healthcare Spending amounted to €37.3 billion.
The need 
A phenomenon of such dimensions, such as that of the outburst of private healthcare services, generates important opportunities for those who have chosen to operate in simplifying the crossing between supply and demand of private healthcare.
Apart from the few competitors referred to in the next paragraph, the current scenario is characterized by extreme fragmentation and asymmetry of information between the side of supply and the side of demand.
This involves:
•	for doctors, great difficulty in intercepting the demand for services they may provide, given the substantially handcrafted model of the management of bookings. This is particularly true for operators that are not yet established;
•	for patients, difficulty in obtaining information and, above all, their qualifications in choosing a professional to place trust in and the timetable for contacting doctors and booking appointments. 
The competitors
Docspecial.it
Weaknesses:
•	name and reputation have to still be created.
•	Patient contact system that easily circumvents for subsequent visits, especially in the initial phase.
•	We anticipate difficulties in the initial phase in the management and collection of payments by doctors. In fact, the collection system expects monthly invoices to be sent to doctors for services carried out in the previous month.
Strengths:
•	No monthly fee and free if unused. Therefore, it is convenient for low volumes. The objective is to generate high traffic of visits and volume of registered members.
•	Flexibility of the platform. The platform was conceived not only for individual professionals but also for more complex and organized structures thanks to a complete personalization of the profile, rate tables, and services.
•	Innovative graphic research system through a representation of the human body where patients can select the most suitable professional for their problem/pathology in just a few clicks.
•	System of comments, feedback, and trustworthy user rankings. Unlike competitors, the rankings will not be carried out on the basis of the amount paid but on the criteria of mere reputation and feedback from patients, therefore, creating an objective and reliable point of reference over time.
Miodottore.it
The website of Polish owner of the docplanner brand, an Italian re-adaptation of a model that is operating in Poland with many investments backing it up (active in Italy for about 2 years now).
They offer an annual subscription service (obligation to pay for 12 continuous months - automatic renewal for the following year, cancellation to be communicated 3 months before the automatic renewal). Payment is carried by monthly installments.
Average annual subscription fee: 98 euros/month + VAT - or 1176 euros per year + VAT (total: 1434.72 euros per year) 
The annual subscription includes, in addition to the service of visibility and booking visits on the site, the creation of an individual web page area for doctors (with domain namesurname.it), the possibility of answering patient questions on the personal page, assistance in creating a profile, and reviews from patients.
B2b marketing strategy: a doctor is contacted by a “broker” who will not give previews by telephone on the type of service, but will book an appointment in person with the doctor illustrating the services offered with the relative price. If the doctor makes a decision, the broker will offer a discount on the proposed amount, which is valid for that day only.
•	Strengths: they are the most widespread in the area, have obtained more investments, the highest number of participating doctors, well indexed on Google.
•	Weaknesses: expensive and binding subscription, they do not have the “human body” to aid the patient in the choosing of a specialist, little publicity for the patient (they are still very focused on the B2B aspect). 
Dottori.it: 
Web site owned by Consulcesi, a legal medical assistance site spread throughout the United Kingdom, USA, Switzerland, Italy, and Albania.
Possibility of registration by a single doctor or private clinic. They offer all types of profiles: app dottori.it that can be downloaded on a smartphone and/or tablet for booking a visit for patients + agenda app for doctors.
They offer an annual subscription service per doctor (obligation to pay 12 continuous months - without automatic renewal for the following year) with 2 subscription profiles, respectively excellence and excellenceplus. The possibility of one lump sum payment or monthly installments. 
Medical profile Excellence: €399 yearly + VAT (tot: €486.78 per year, or 40.56 euros per month). This profile offers, in addition to the basic services listed above, searchability within the site for a maximum of 30 services and a maximum of 50 illnesses treated + a
hyper-specialization. Maximum distance criterion of 100 km.
Medical profile Excellenceplus: €699 annual + VAT (tot: €852.78 per year, or € 71.06 euros per month). This profile guarantees, in addition to the basic services listed above, a ranking at the top of the list, unlimited research for services, pathologies, and territorial extension, as well as the possibility to insert 3 hyperspecializations, links to personal website (created personally and not from the portal).
B2B marketing strategy: contact a doctor by phone and explain the types of contract, offering discounts if the decision is made within a few days.
• Strengths: better ranking on Google (searching “online doctors”), probable pharmaceutical sponsorships, more widespread B2C advertising (advertising on national television networks)
•	Weaknesses: they do not have a large number of doctors registered, they are weaker in the B2B phase compared to miodottore.it because they do not carry out a comprehensive recruitment campaign, they do not have the “human body” to aid the patient in choosing a specialist, difficulty for doctors to register at the site (there is no direct method but one must enter an email address in order to be contacted later on).
idoctors.it:
•	Strengths: Allows direct online booking, medium/low distribution on the territory and per number of participating specialists,
•	Weaknesses: Unfavorable ranking on Google and in marketing for both B2B and B2C, they do not have the “human body” to aid the patient in the choosing of a specialist, difficulty for doctors to register at the site (there is no direct method but one must enter an email address in order to be contacted later on), medium/low distribution on the territory and per number of participating specialists.
Medicalbox.it:
A Made in Italy website (Parma) that does NOT place emphasis on specialists but rather on outpatient clinics and private centers. It is NOT possible to register as an individual specialist but rather they consist of agreements with private centers, where it is possible to book desired services directly online. For this reason, it does not represent a direct competitor because it has a different purpose (it does not aim at improving the activity of a specialist and/or house visits).
 
Dottoreadomicilio.it: 
A website that is aimed solely at booking house visits. It is mainly directed at general practitioners or pediatricians. It does NOT offer the possibility to book specialist visits, it does NOT offer the possibility to book outpatient visits, it does NOT offer the possibility of high personalization by a doctor of your profile.
Moreover, it has low distribution both in the territory as well as for the number of registered doctors.
For these reasons, it does not represent a true competitor of our website, which is positioned in a wider and more flexible market. 
Uwell.it: 
Website sponsored by Sanofi, integrated with pharmacies, offers visibility to the specialist but does not allow direct booking of visits (however, it will allow you to view the name, phone number and address of a clinic).
This feature is supported by dottori.it: for this reason, it is within the objective of dottori.it as a competitor.
 The marketing strategy 
The business model 
The revenue model
We will earn 5% on every visit that is actually carried out through our portal. We expect 4 price ranges5 where professionals can position themselves on the basis of their professional experience and reputation.
- Range 1 
40 Euro - Physiotherapists, nurses, osteopaths, and other healthcare professions. The price refers to a service or hourly rate. The service can be performed via a house visit or at a clinic or affiliated doctor’s office.
5 *The price is purely suggested and based on the average of national tariffs.
Please note that there are currently no tariffs imposed, official and unified for any professional category. 
- Range 2 
40-50 Euro - Non specialist doctors, general practitioners.
The price refers to a single carried out service. The service can be performed via a house visit or at a clinic or affiliated doctor’s office.
- Range 3
80-100 Euro - Medical specialists but with less than 10 years of experience. The rate is to be considered a service that can be performed via a house visit or at a facility chosen by the doctor.
The rate is to be considered a single carried out service. It does not include treatments that make use of diagnostic instruments and equipment, and consumables.
- Range 4
Over 100 Euros - Medical specialists, university professors, directors of simple or complex structures.
The rate is to be considered a service that can be performed via a house visit or at a facility chosen by the doctor. It does not include treatments that make use of diagnostic instruments and equipment, and consumables.
We are able to maintain this convenient marketing strategy thanks to the work of pharmaceutical representatives, thanks to which we will develop a sales network and B2B marketing.
This strategy, exclusively adopted by us, will allow us to take advantage of already trained, efficient personnel and with unique medical know-how.
We will avail ourselves of potential sponsorships coming mainly from the pharmaceutical insurance sectors.
Following the numerous ministerial laws that regulate and prevent the prescription of
certain classes of pharmaceuticals, imposing the prescription of generic drugs, has pushed various companies to a strong inhibition and limitation in the sponsorship of their products.
In the next few years, we will be a safe resource for insurance companies, for companies will be able to purchase healthcare assistance packages through our platform, offering a constant and widespread assistance service, lowering costs of healthcare agreements with clinics and medical offices bound by large operating costs and limited in certain geographical areas and by certain time tables. 
The operational plan 
Business plan 
The pilot project involves the metropolitan area of Florence and Bologna, counting on a potential pool of about 1.5 million users between the ages of 3 and 100.
The potential doctors, outpatient clinics, general clinics, partners and offices present in the above-mentioned areas are about 7,000 units.
For an ideal information campaign and recruiting of the latter we can count on, as previously mentioned, the availability of pharmaceutical representatives already present in the territory, on promotions at conventions and industry fairs, on the activity in social networks through educational, informational, editorial material and interactive video that we will produce daily for doctors and patients. We are counting on reaching 50% of the 7000 units in the first 4 months of work.
At the same time, we will continue to develop the patient interface as well as improve the interface for doctors. We expect the medical-patient operation to be complete starting in April 2019.
On the basis of the hypothesized data, it can be established that:
One specialist doctor purchases a supply of about 3,000 users and performs an average of 15-20 visits a day for about 5 days a week.
Let us suppose that in the initial phase two visits a day can be performed thanks to our portal, we earn:
2 x 90 = 180 x 5 = 900 euros profit in favor of docspecial.it, which is 45 euros per week, 6.42 euros per doctor per day.
This calculation can also be applied to a non-specialist doctor.
This figure, given the impossibility of its use in public hospitals for legal reasons and given the shortage of offers addressed to this figure, can result in being much more flexible to carry out their work during night time slots and weekends, and still offer a wide range category of services such as writing prescriptions and medical documents, simple treatments, consultations and prescriptions of examinations.
We assume there will be 4-5 visits a night on weekdays through our site and about 10 visits a day on weekends and holidays.
Physiotherapists, nurses, and professionals can treat and assist from 5 (if at home) to 8 patients a day usually from Monday to Saturday.
Starting in 2020, when the two pilot provinces (Florence and Bologna) are fully operational, Docspecial operations will also be extended to Milan, Turin and subsequently in the Veneto region.
On the basis of the following plan, the following sales trend is expected (number of transactions brokered by Docspecial).",,

In order to better understand the Chap project, we first need to know what a so-called SDK is. The term SDK is an abbreviation of the English description ""software development kit"". Imagine a code that has been developed to integrate in any existing application with little effort, similar to the functionalities of a plug-in. The target customers of Chap are companies that run a webshop and want to implement an augmented reality (AR) application for marketing purposes without having to bear the high development costs themselves.
The Chap SDK is available for download directly from Chap's corporate website. With the download of the SDK's also a tutorial is included, which describes the simple implementation of the software in just a few steps. As soon as the Chap SDK has been integrated into a webshop, it will be extended by an innovative marketing tool. Chap offers companies the opportunity to communicate with their customers in a new disruptive way with the emerging world of Augmented Reality (AR). Moreover it will be possible to cost-effectively test new advertising opportunities offered by geodata technology.
In order to make the implementation of the software as user-friendly as possible, Chap will provide its customers with a specially designed dashboard. After the implementation of the SDK, a company profile of the customer is created directly on the Chap Dashboard. The company can access the dashboard via an assigned login name and password and place their chaps.
What is a chap? A chap is a virtual pin that can be placed by companies anywhere and will show up as push notifications with or without augmented reality from the customers.
What opportunities does the chap dashboard offer to a company?
The main function of the dashboard is the possibility to place chaps on a Map (E.g. Google Maps).
Moreover the company has the possibility to choose between different types of chaps and to trigger these at a certain coordinate. So you can place coupons, products or advertisements and adapt them to individual customer needs and marketing goals.
Example 1:
A company has the opportunity to place for a customers birthday a virtual package directly in front of their door which includes a birthday congratulation and a voucher for the next purchase.
Example 2:
A sports company has the opportunity to place a chap on top of the mountain and the athlete customer who picks up the chap first, gets a voucher for a new avalanche search device.
Example 3:
A company has the opportunity to lay a chap in front of a fair, where they can not be present. All customers of the company visiting the fair are made aware of the placed advertising of the company when they arrive.
Analytics:
The company will not only increase Chap's performance, but also gain relevant data that could guide the marketing department's next steps in the right direction. Part of the dashboard is designed to bring the data gained to the company through a clear analytical image in the Analytics section.
Support:
In order to ensure the correct and easy implementation of the SDK, Chap will have a live support. Its task is to help companies with the integration and possible technical problems.",,

From plumbing to wedding planning, Ernesto offers a wide range of services to cater to the diverse needs of its customers.",Rome,"marketplace, home services, local businesses",No funding announced yet,2017,https://www.ernestopro.com/,IT,"Customers provide detailed posts for potential jobs (e.g. home remodeling, plumbing, seeking electricians or painters, etc.).
Interested professionals use the platform to bid on those jobs by detailing a price and description of their services.
Customers then compare professionals based on price, customer reviews, and other elements of the bids.
Customers finally hire the right professional for the job.
Ernesto has over 100.000 projects requested every year in over 500 different categories. The company operates in Italy, UK, and the US and has over 130.000 professionals on its platform.
Platforms like Ernesto, aimed at fulfilling consumer service requests are becoming increasingly attractive to these small business owners since these platforms generally involve a minimal investment of time or money on the part of the local merchant.
Rather than paying upfront for advertisements that may or may not generate actual leads, business owners can sit back and wait for leads to come to them.
Which problem is Ernesto solving for Local Professionals?
In general, Customers can easily find professionals but professionals often have trouble finding customers. So Ernesto provides a fair marketing tool that allows professionals to find key customers in a less costly and more efficient way.
Many professionals are not happy with current methods to promote their business online because they are spending too much money for too few results!
In fact, using technologies like Google Adwords in this market they risk to spend up to €17 per click on their website which is not even a lead. Meanwhile using other websites they spend up to 100 € per lead and most of the time customers don’t even answer back.",,
