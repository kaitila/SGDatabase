This causes a supply shock and holding Bitcoin while the market adjusts to the lower supply and higher cost of production. This provides a great investment opportunity.
However, this occurs only once every four years. The tokens have been designed to allow investors to take advantage of this effect once every nine months.
Nine months after the rate of production of Spring tokens is halved, the same thing happens to Summer, and then nine months after that, the Autumn halving takes place, and so on. Each token in turn is subjected to a supply shock, causing the prices of the tokens to rise in a predictable sequence: Spring tokens will tend to rise in price, then Summer, Autumn, Winter, and Spring again.
Investors can continually increase the total number of tokens they own by trading the more expensive tokens for the cheaper ones.
Winter tokens are currently the most expensive, and Spring tokens are the cheapest. Investors who trade Winter for Spring will gain about 60% more tokens in total. Later this year, Spring tokens will become the most expensive and valuable of the four tokens, and the price of Spring can be expected to rise. Investors can then trade Spring tokens for Summer, which will then be the cheapest, and gain more tokens in total once again.
By trading the tokens in a cycle, investors can increase the total number of tokens in their investment."

Chatbots quickly become the best personal shopper, problem solver, and friend your clients have never met.
In marketing, for example, chatbots can guide customers to the information they’re looking for, inspire them or help them choose the right products, or enhance employee productivity by automating necessary processes.
There are two types of chatbots that can simulate human conversations and the type you go with really depends on your needs and on what problem you’re trying to solve:
Script-based chatbots are simple and rule-based, meaning they respond to specific commands and follow a predefined script and flow. They’re only as smart as you make them. So don’t go asking it the wrong thing…. Script-based chatbots are often used in customer service, as shopping assistants or for simple things like weather forecasts.
AI-powered chatbots have an artificial brain function that uses machine learning and draws on context, meaning your clients don’t have to be specific when asking questions. Best of all, they learn over time – like Siri, they’re designed to be “human,” they can find you things based on your history of likes and dislikes and your searches over time.
We focus on configuring a chatbot that users will keep coming back to and that will continue to provide value for your users time after time."

What makes us unique?
1. Many paperless weddings solution simply send an email to the guests and the couples must collect their responses. Our product is different because every guest guests their very own secure copy of 'Be Our Guest' and this facilitates communications all the way through the wedding journey.
2. We are artists as well as developers. I paint and sell my own fine art (acrylics, watercolours and oil pastels). As part of our process we develop our own art for exclusive use with 'Be Our Guest' and use the digital prints for backgrounds.
3. Our product is private and secure. There are quite a few free wedding websites out there and undoubtedly free mobile applications will come along. Their business model is often based on reselling customer details and pushing paid suppliers on couples. Their sites are often public too. In our market research this was something that was abhorrent to couples.
We set about changing this. We make our money from selling our product. We do not charge suppliers to be listed or linked with us. We do not share customer information and we password protect and securely store everything.

This weighted average is also likely to outperform one single currency. Yuro’s smart contract provides a convenient, transparent, and secure manner for exchanging Yuro tokens for Ethereum.
