A lot of content does not live up to users’ expectations, resulting in a loss of interest over time. Our system ensures a consistently high-quality user experience throughout the user’s media consumption. Besides making adaptable stories, the solution will become a fully automated quality assurance system. Using biosensors, the system detects the psychophysiological reaction of users and automatically adjusts the content based on their immediate needs. 

Moreover, we are working on Biometric Quality Assurance.
Conventionally, media production companies invest a significant amount of time and money in creating high-quality productions. Yet, this is not always a warranty for success. Quality assurance is often not used within the creative production phase but rather at the end of production when most of the financial and creative resources have already been spent.

It’s like AirBNB, but for classes: from languages to baking, people can share what they know most about.  We offer live classes taught by real people, where people teach a subject because they care and know a lot about it.  On PassionClass, years of experience matter more than almost anything else.  
PassionClass is truly the best place on earth to learn a language.  Duolingo sounds great, but do you know anyone who’s actually learned to speak from an app?  You need classes, group energy, and human connection to get immersed in a language- an opportunity to come and share and exchange and experience, which is what language is truly about.  Our platform fosters this immersive experience, where learners benefit from the dynamic energy of group classes and forge meaningful human connections essential for language proficiency. Yet we offer this for a fraction of the cost of a university, plus, best of all: no grades.  Languages are back to being fun, and PassionClass is more than just learning; it's a platform for sharing, exchanging, and experiencing the essence of language.  �
PassionClass is also the best place on the internet to learn new skills.  Want to learn to bake?  Do it here.  Want to learn an instrument?  Get started right away.  Want to share the way you became a chess grandmaster?  On PassionClass, you can use your creativity to teach what you’re most passionate about.  The collaborative nature of our classes not only enhances learning but also makes it a more socially enriching experience- while also saving you money.
PassionClass is also a leading platform in the realm of creative arts, providing an unmatched opportunity for individuals to explore and cultivate their artistic talents. Whether aspiring painters, musicians, or writers, PassionClass offers a vibrant space where creators can hone their craft under the guidance of experienced instructors. Group classes in creative arts foster a supportive environment where learners can receive feedback, collaborate with peers, and draw inspiration from diverse perspectives. By combining passion with expertise, PassionClass empowers individuals to unleash their creativity, express themselves authentically, and embark on a transformative journey of artistic discovery. 
But perhaps the most valuable aspect of PassionClass is the sense of community it fosters. Learning is inherently social, and our platform provides a space for like-minded individuals to connect, collaborate, and support each other.  PassionClass is where you'll find your group: if they’re in a class because they care, then you share interests and maybe a natural connection.
A personal tutor can cost $25, $50, $100 or more per hour.  By sharing the cost of instruction on PassionClass, individuals can access high-quality learning experiences at a fraction of the price they would pay for one-on-one sessions, while teachers make real money. Plus, reviews of classes let you know whether a class is good or great before you book.  This efficient allocation of resources enables PassionClass to offer a wider variety of courses while keeping classes affordable. Additionally, group environments foster peer interaction and collaborative learning, enhancing the overall educational experience. In essence, group classes at PassionClass make quality education accessible to a broader audience, promoting lifelong learning and personal development.",https://www.linkedin.com/company/passionclass/

Sellers need to take photos, make descriptions, haggle with buyers and meet them on their doorsteps. Buyers too must haggle with sellers, buy stuff based on low quality images and visit several sellers when buying used goods. In addition, there are challenges with trust, cheating, warranty and returns. The result is that only 47% of the Danes bothered to sell anything on an online market in 2020 (Genbrugsindekset 2021). Quality items with many years of use left in them ends up in basements, ceilings and storage services and are eventually thrown out. That is a fundamental and unnecessary waste in a society struggling with climate change. 
A used item is unique, it has an individual story. You cannot sell it on a generic product ad. The photo and description must be of the individual item. New items are on the contrary interchangeable. Sellers can sell thousands of identical items on the same product ad. This has up until now made the handling and selling of used single items at scale prohibitively expensive.

We are bringing paper and books back into the traveling experience. We have taken it upon ourselves to liberate content from its current constrained formats and distracting social media. Instead, we let you curate inspiration & expert content to create personal travel guides. We remain digital only to help you to enjoy the distinct experience of a printed book. We do this because memories in books have the power to last.
• Travel Kollekt takes personal travel planning to a whole new level. It is the only tool that allows travellers from all over the world to organize information and create personalized travel guide books.
• Our mission: empower people to take authorship of their journey to create the best memories. We want to remind travellers that personal choices matter!
• Travel Kollekt was born from a personal need. After a trip to Myanmar, Louise realized that the time invested in pre-trip research has a direct impact on the quality of later memories. That is, travel time may be short, but good planning helps create memories that will last forever. So why not to create a tool that assists organize the mess of the planning process and that helps celebrate the research instead?
• Focuses on a growing audience of travellers looking for personalization, Travel Kollekt is the ideal partner for those who celebrate planning with great joy. Travel Kollekt empower informed travellers!
• The tool combines different technologies into a single platform, allowing users to store travel information; scraping content from websites; organizing data within a map; customize guides through the book editor. We have created a solution that celebrates the inspiration and planning process with beautiful design, aesthetics, simplicity, and technology.
• Travel Kollekt offers the natural and most handy way to organize content. We provide an easy template that automatically translates all texts, images, maps, addresses, and links into a fixed grid and then generate a guide book.
• The ""kollekts"" fits with most languages in the world, allowing users to scrape content from any source while retaining the original characters.
• Travel Kollekt is building a global database of professional writing to offer to travellers that want to go deeper and understand a destination from a more responsible and contemporary perspective.
• When we encourage people to go deep in their research, we are creating a new landscape for tourism, a responsible way of thinking. That is why we are aligned with The Global Code of Ethics for Tourism. The World Tourism Organization (UNWTO) states that to be a responsible traveller, you should ""Learn as much as possible about your destination and take time to understand the customs, norms, and traditions.""
• We provide curated city guides and essays written by local authors and partners from more than five countries (so far). We think that people and companies who dedicate their time and knowledge to help other travellers should be rewarded, so the collaboration is done with a revenue share that always favors
the creators and authors – precisely the way it should be. Thus, any user can purchase the content, directly contributing to more responsible tourism.
• We work to offer insights and information that will help sustainability in tourism to become a regular part of any travel experience.",

Where internal departments are working with their own focus on content and objectives, knowledge sharing across other departments will only take place at meetings or on special occasions.
Pressure on marketing departments is increasing, inevitably causing stress, frustration and wastage of resources. An increased pressure that calls for a digital transformation and a new work structure.
Today, more than half of marketing executives work to decentralize their efforts to meet a digital transformation and achieve the company's growth goals.

To launch campaigns and to keep up with customers. Service, communication and presence are essential for a company that needs to market itself well. Often, the division of labor is divided between departments, systems and freelancers, which makes coordination demanding and difficult.

Mapscaping,https://www.eu-startups.com/directory/mapscaping/,Denmark,"MAPSCAPING.COM - MAPS WITH A STORY

We love natural landscapes and we love maps!. Maps are perhaps as fundamental to society as language and the written word. Maps tell stories by recording information, about the location and spatial characteristics of the natural world and of society and culture. There is just something fascinating about looking at a landscape and imagining the processes that have shaped it.  Maps are magical, they represent the past, the present and hint at the possibilities for the future.


How we make our designs

Our topographic map designs are based on elevation data. Each of our designs is the result of hundreds of millions of elevation measurements. These measurements are then filtered into a single elevation measurement for every 30 square meters or 98 square feet. Because the geographic location of each elevation measurement is known it can be displayed as a highly-detailed map.


What we do

Our high-resolution maps are made from real data. We process the data, add the colors and let nature do the rest. The result is a beautifully detailed image, 126-megapixel image of a landscape stripped of vegetation, and man-made objects. We use two different design styles to highlight the natural topography of a landscape",Vejle,"topographic, maps, art",No funding announced yet,2018,MapScaping.com,,DK,,

Her idea to start a Danish opportunity for online psychological help arose when one day she was sitting and had a sudden need to talk to someone about a problem.
The vision behind We.Care is therefore that it should be easier for all Danes to get psychological help. Because far too many people need someone to talk to about their mental challenges without it happening. Some have difficulty getting outside their own door due to  anxiety . Someone has trouble getting time for a psychologist due to career bustle. Someone has no surplus to find a psychologist because of stress. And many are stopped because long waits do not work when you need help here and now.

Our platform empowers managers to be great leaders and meet the new generations’ desire for more recognition, involvement and development. It brings employees and managers closer together by facilitating their cooperation through continuous, constructive and forward-looking dialogues.
When first developing our software, it was abundantly clear to us that while there is much talk in the corporate world about good leadership and it’s crucial importance in every aspect of business, surprisingly little is done to support managers in being good leaders. It’s for that reason that we created Duuoo with the goal of giving every manager the tools they need to be a great leader.
With Duuoo, companies become the owner of a product that forges strong professional relationships through meaningful conversation, a product that allows them to create a true coaching culture in their organization. It’s a tremendous help to the time-pressed leader.
To be blunt, the annual review is dead. And we say good riddance. Setting aside time for only one serious talk about performance and development over the course of a year is absolutely inadequate, and a sure way to create disengaged, unmotivated and unhappy employees.
Today’s employees need active guidance, support, coaching and clear goals that align with their individual purpose. They need a deeply committed leader. The sad truth is, however, that many managers have neither the time, nor the training, nor the tools necessary to make this commitment. That’s where Duuoo comes in. We automate the admin of scheduling meetings and sending out calendar invites, provide helpful and timely notification, supply them with content and learnings to inspire meaningful conversation, and give them an overview of everything happening with their team at a glance.
Contemporary studies show us that people have a deep desire for purpose in their job, just as in their life. They crave meaning; and they look for their leader to help them find it. It’s a big job, no doubt about it, but with the right tools, we truly believe every manager is up to the task.",

OpenLedger ApS,https://www.eu-startups.com/directory/openledger-aps/,Denmark,"BUSINESS MADE SIMPLE WITH VIMPLE

Existing blockchain projects provide the user with no guarantee of network stability and offer no protection of legal rights.

The decision: to develop a legal blockchain created from the ground up for enterprise needs, enabling businesses to leverage all the advantages of peer-to-peer tools and services in organising their processes with domestic and global counterparts.",Copenhagen,,,2014,https://vpledger.com,,DK,"VPLedger blockchain ecosystem - Enterprise first, on every level
Existing blockchain projects provide the user with no guarantees of network stability and offer no
protection of legal rights. Businesses have therefore lacked the practical and legal reassurances they
need to leverage the considerable advantages of blockchain technology.
VPLedger is built from the ground up for enterprise needs, enabling businesses to integrate powerful
peer-to-peer tools and services into their processes within a clear legal framework.
Vision
VPLedger was created to offer businesses the
benefits of blockchain technology and
peer-to-peer financial operations, within a
stable, reliable technical framework and with
the legal and regulatory guarantees that
have previously been absent in the sector.
VPLedger’s ‘enterprise first’ ethos is evidenced
in a number of key features:
● High transaction throughput, suited for the
needs of global business.
● Suite of powerful tools and services,
including smart contracts, a decentralised
exchange, token creation, stablecoins and
other digital assets.
● Mandatory KYC for all users.
● Permissioned network with known
validating nodes, verified through
enhanced KYC.
● ‘Protective democracy’ approach, founded
on a Constitution.
● Clear legal framework for redress in the
event of fraudulent transactions.
VPLedger addresses both the technical and
regulatory shortcomings of earlier blockchains
and decentralised platforms, which have thus far
discouraged businesses from integrating these
new technologies into their processes.
The result is an ecosystem of decentralised
products and services, open to all but
accessible only by individuals and entities
willing to undergo identity verification. Within
this blockchain network, users are free to
undertake any activity they wish, subject to the
regulation in the relevant jurisdiction.
Technical approach
VPLedger is built on Graphene 3.0 , the
technology underpinning the BitShares
network. The use of a permissioned ledger
with a limited number of known, approved
validating nodes enables throughput of 100,000
transactions per second . Consensus is
achieved via the VPG algorithm.
The platform hosts a virtual machine, running
Ethereum-based smart contracts and
decentralised applications (dApps), enabling
businesses to execute complex logic in a
trustless environment.
The native currency and default means of
payment within the VPLedger ecosystem is
Vimples (VPL) : a unified, frictionless currency
for a global single market of blockchain
products and services. Unlike conventional
open blockchains, the task of securing the
network and processing transactions is
separated out from the payment layer; Vimples
are designed to function solely as a means of
accessing software services , rather than as a

and e-commerce sites outside of the VPLedger
platform.
Users who purchase membership enjoy

billion VPL will fund platform marketing and
development.
Constitution

by the relevant authorities

directly by the users themselves. The blockchain is developed and maintained by the legal entity of

Our technology analyses a given customers order records and defines a desired brand's size in less than a second.
For a new online-shop customer, the only thing we ask is to add any known brand size. And for a returning online-shop customer, EasySize can define the size by analysing previous order records and show it on every open page - so the customer shouldn't do anything at all.

TECHNOLOGY

EasySize is built on a technology analysing online-shops orders records. It means that the size is calculated not based on what clients think they look like or prefer to think they look like, but on a hard data - what they actually buy, return and do not return.
The core algorithm uses various factors from manufacturing country to clothes cut and fabric in order to define the correct size. Using a machine learning it can dynamically in real time update results and becomes smarter every time an order is made on an online-shop.
During tests with real online-shops in Europe EasySize predicted the correct size which customers did not return in 79,45% of all cases.
