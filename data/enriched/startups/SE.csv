Chik,https://www.eu-startups.com/directory/chik/,Sweden,Chik is the most easy-to-use task manager for freelancers and small teams.,"Chik – The collaborative task manager for freelancers
Chik is the answer to bloated, overly complicated, and sluggish project management software (looking at you Notion and Monday). It's the only task manager built specifically for freelancers and offers only what you actually need:
Time tracking: Track within Chik, per-task. Clients can see the total time tracked. Only you can see the individual log history.
Client dashboard: Give your clients a dedicated dashboard to submit, view, and edit tasks as well as communicate with the built in context-aware chat.
Team members: Even freelancers occasionally bring someone onboard, so invite them directly to your Chik team.
Live chat: Use our context-aware live chat to keep client communication focused. Bye bye Slack, Email, WhatsApp.
How is Chik different?
Chik was born from genuine freelancer frustration.
After years of running my own web studio, I (Jonathan, the founder) found myself constantly battling with task management tools that seemed designed for everyone except me.
Notion demanded endless customization before I could even begin working. Asana and Monday buried essential functions under complex workflows meant for large teams.
Every morning, I'd waste precious billable time clicking through bloated interfaces just to figure out what needed my attention.
That's why I created Chik—a task manager that respects a freelancer's time and workflow. Unlike the corporate-focused alternatives, Chik strips away unnecessary features and focuses exclusively on what independent professionals actually need: clear task visibility, straightforward client collaboration, and contextual communication—all in one uncluttered interface.
Chik isn't trying to be everything for everyone; it's specifically crafted for freelancers who need simplicity and efficiency, by someone who lived their challenges firsthand.
Pricing That Makes Sense
Chik is free for freelancers working with their first couple of clients or small team. As your business grows, our affordable pricing scales with you: just €11/month for unlimited client connections and team members. No complex tiers or hidden fees, just straightforward value for independent professionals.",Sundsvall,"Freelancer Task Manager, Time Tracking, Client Dashboard, Project Collaboration, Live Chat, Team Management, Simple Workflow, Chik App, Notion Alternative, Freelance Productivity",Between €1-€100K,2025,http://chik.app,Active,https://www.linkedin.com/company/chik-app,SE

At Jord, we envision a future free of fossil fuel emissions. Our approach harnesses nature’s potential to produce renewable fuels without using farmland for food production or wood from forests.
Our holistic approach uses C4 grass, grown on marginal and degraded land in the tropics, as the primary feedstock for renewable, CO₂e-negative solid biofuels. Jord addresses three key challenges:
• Revitalizing degraded land,
• Reducing dependency on fossil fuels, and
• Lowering atmospheric CO₂ levels.
Our regenerative agroforestry model uses C4 grasses to absorb CO₂ and store it in their tissues, root systems, and soil, enriching and improving soil health over time. With the harvested grass, we produce two primary products:
• Solid biofuels, a sustainable energy source for heat and power generation in industry.
• Biochar, which is added to soil to enhance fertility, improve crop yields, and increase soil quality. Biochar remains stable for centuries, locking carbon in the soil long-term.
Additionally, Jord offers tailored carbon credits for businesses seeking to offset their carbon emissions by compensating for unavoidable emissions within their value chains.",Stockholm,"Biofuels, Carbon Credits, Biochar, Regenerative agriculture",No funding announced yet,2017,https://www.jord.one/,Active,https://www.linkedin.com/company/jordab,SE

Charly was founded in 2022 with a mission to bring financial freedom to women. We want to reduce the gap between men and women's lifetime income, starting with creating opportunities for equal pensions. Charly has a unique platform that helps parents understand the economic effect of how they have divided family responsibilities. Responsibilities such as parental leave, part-time work to take care of the family, and staying home with sick children. After calculating and visualizing the economic effect these choices have on your lifetime income, Charly offers a ""Love Insurance"" to compensate for the inequalities. The insurance is a long-term savings plan in which you together as a couple set aside savings to make up for the unequal division. The insurance also ensures financial compensation in case of separation or divorce. Since almost 50% of marriages in Sweden end in divorce, the compensation for unpaid work to take care of the family is a critical gender equality issue.From now on all families can take action to become more financially equal with Charly.",Stockholm,Fintech,Between €5 million-€10 million,2022,https://charly.se/,Active,https://www.linkedin.com/company/charly-equity,SE

This is more than a change; it's a seismic shift in the skincare industry, and it's here to elevate your daily grind, redefine how we look at beauty, and empower every active woman out there.""

Digmak is a platform where users can find & book international tax experts. The database of tax regulations & typical cases helps simulate answers, saving time & money for users. Our platform does not provide consulting services but rather a database of international tax firms and smart matchmaking for freelancers, digital nomads, expats and MSMEs. Digmak envisions bringing mobility in tax consulting and digitalizing the traditional taxation process.","Digmak caters to the new generation of professionals who travel more, are expats, freelancers & digital nomads. It is becoming the norm & with the pandemic, an accelerated trend. Most of big companies have recently jumped on the bandwagon of “Work from Anywhere”. 
The lifestyle is attractive but living & moving to different countries creates huge tax hassles. Furthermore, obtaining access to tax regulations in english, inter-governmental policies & tax experts with international expertise is a rising problem. Relying on traditional methods such as expensive accounting firms & law firms with little international experience is no longer a viable option. Local experts do not like to cater to this international community, who requires more attention & support. 
Hence, we conducted surveys, collected feedback from the nomad community & case scenarios from experts to understand the extent of the problem. We even handled various international client requests ourselves. 
To solve this problem better, Digmak is rolling out our platform, to connect nomads & experts, in September. The project lays the basic foundation of mobility in tax consulting much like the stripped down, platform version of KRY.  The platform answers the need for a global directory of international tax experts available remotely & the future demand for a smarter solution to save time.
Our partnerships with 13 tax consulting firms serving 14 popular nomad destination countries in Europe gives us a huge boost. Lack of nomad solutions in the post pandemic era creates a golden opportunity for us. With few competitors focusing on this target audience, we are early to market with many eager to partner with us.
With a validated MVP and product market fit launching, we’ll start collecting data & search patterns that will enable our smart platform & later our app, making tax consulting more mobile & flexible.
Digmak will soon operate on a hybrid model of pay as you go & SaaS. Bringing the ease of KRY to tax consulting will be a game-changer due to its simplicity & global demand.",Stokcholm,"platform,fintech,gig,cross-border",Between €1-€100K,2021,www.digmak.com,,,SE

When it comes to radiators, users experience a better and more even heat from the radiator. For property owners, a simple, fast energy efficiency with fast payoff and large measurable CO2 reduction.","NxNANO AB
We are a company that wants to contribute to building a more sustainable future by thinking a little outside the box. With our curiosity, experience, energy and drive, we are not afraid to take the calculated risks that introductions of new products and services on the market entail.
Many companies focus heavily on finding innovative ways to reduce energy consumption around the world and create added value that enables companies and real estate to maintain their profitability, as global energy reserves are depleted and energy costs continue to rise.
The conventional heat transfer systems associated with industries such as microelectronics, transportation, manufacturing, power generation, heat transfer in real estate and many other technologies have lagged behind. Cooling is a major challenge for many industries, where the operation of equipment can produce a large amount of excess heat, and this may soon hamper the development of future technologies in terms of design and efficiency.
Liquids are often used in refrigeration systems to dissipate heat or maintain an even temperature, but a ""nanofliquid"" refrigerant can significantly improve the cooling process, which benefits a number of industries, such as industrial machinery, electric motors, medical equipment, power generation and the process industry.
This also applies to the reverse in heating systems where ""nano liquids"" conduct heat much faster and thereby reduce the load on pumps and other equipment. Water is the most common liquid in all heating systems in properties. HTF Compact together with our product WES - water-improving solution to stabilize that the right PH value is in the system is tomorrow's coolant.
In short, our solution is about utilizing liquid flows in all heating and cooling systems and with a simple injection of HTF Compact during ongoing operation increase heat or cooling capacity which radically reduces electricity consumption and other loads on existing systems and is experienced positively by users.
When it comes to radiators, users experience a better and more even heat from the radiator. For property owners, a simple, fast energy efficiency with fast payoff and large measurable CO2 reduction.
OUR BUSINESS IDEA
Our business idea is to, together with selected strategic partners, introduce and together offer new both cost- and energy- and environmentally efficient complete solutions in areas such as Real Estate, Schools, Hotels, Arenas, Datacenters, the Food Industry and other Industries that have heating / cooling-intensive operations
Against this background, we have established collaborations with some of the leading players in heating, cooling and property automation in the Baltic Sea area.
It is now our intention to, in close collaboration with these, introduce HTF Compact®,. a patented nanobasic solution that can be injected during ongoing operation into most closed, liquid-based heating and cooling systems and that can improve energy consumption by up to 40%.
The patents are held by Italian TCT Nanotech, a business area within TCT SRL.
NxNano AB has the exclusive market rights to HTF Compact® in the Nordic and Baltic countries.

By integrating Layke with third-party suppliers, we have the opportunity to reach a broad customer base via a single integration. In this way, the product is scalable. 
In an ever-growing market, Layke supports recruiting companies to fill in positions faster and more efficiently based on clear and objective data. Our algorithm transforms a process where the unconscious human bias sometimes can’t be avoided and encourages transparent, skill-based recruitment. 
Trained on a large amount of data, Layke’s algorithm has the capacity to structure, read and analyse documents as a human resource, but faster. The solution is built using advanced machine learning technology and can be seamlessly integrated with existing systems through a single API. 
Supported by advanced machine learning technology, Layke can be divided into two parts: extracting information from documents and matching them with each other. When extracting the unstructured information, Layke uses modern machine learning technology where graph networks are in focus. When it comes to matching, with the help of language comprehension (NLP), Layke can compare different candidates to a job advertisement and answer which ones match best. By learning to group words together, the language model learns to understand different word classes but also which words belong together.
Among many competitive factors, the true strength of the solution lies in that it works on material that all candidates already have, and in systems already used by Layke’s customers.  
Layke's technical solution is based on a combination of language models and graph networks, which makes our algorithm unique, thus not possible to copy.
Moreover, we have built our own tool for data labelling, meaning that we can identify raw data so that a machine learning model can learn from it and make predictions on new data.

I februari 2019 rullades Grönbil.se ut och på bara några månader hade sajten dragit till sig över 100 bilhandlare och mer än 500 miljöbilar.","”Det ligger rätt i tiden. Vi ser en stor omställning i bilbranschen och inte minst den stora satsningen på elbilar. Dessutom förändras kundernas beteende hela tiden och alltfler vill kunna köpa bilen på nätet.” säger Ned, en av grundarna.
 Grönbil.se är en miljöbilsajt där du kan köpa och sälja miljöbilar, läsa varierande nyheter från bilvärlden, hitta handlare och verkstäder nära dig, kartsöka landets laddningsstationer och mycket mer. Bakom Grönbil.se står Peter, initiativtagaren med lång erfarenhet av bilbranschen bl. a. tidigare ägare av Kareby bil i Kungälv och hans kollega Ned, webbentreprenören med tidigare kopplingar till KVD och Bilweb.
”Det är solklart att bilbranschen och bilhandeln behöver tänka nytt. Alla som har något med bilhandeln att göra är överens om att kunderna i dag är mer pålästa än någonsin. Förr blev det fyra-fem besök hos bilhandlaren innan det blev affär. Idag sker det oftast vid första besöket. Kunden vet exakt vad den vill ha när den kommer in och i praktiken har den redan bestämt sig.” säger Peter.
Vi går mot en tid där återförsäljarnas roll minimeras och alltfler affärer sker direkt på nätet.
Exempelvis har Tesla helt valt bort återförsäljarledet och vi ser andra biltillverkare hoppa på samma trend. Sedan har vi tydliga klimatmål 2030 där majoriteten av bilarna ska vara rena miljöbilar. Sverige ligger väldigt bra till i denna omställning och efterfrågan för miljöbilar ökar konstant för varje år.

MedTech Concept,https://www.eu-startups.com/directory/medtech-concept-ab/,Sweden,"Medtech Concept AB was founded in 2019 with a vision to become the leading supplier of miniature injection devices globally. 
The company will launch its first product Minipen 2 which will be the smallest injection device in the world. 
The Minipen 2 is three times smaller than existing injection pens, with a narrow-gauge short needle to reduce pain, suitable for vaccinations, cosmetic procedures and 300+ million insulin injecting diabetics.  
We aim to capture 1% of the global market for diabetic injection devices estimated to be worth over $0.5 billion USD per annum.  
Due to an unprecedented demand for injection devices, we have accelerated our product launch plans and now have 15 distributors lined up to purchase the Minipen by the container load. 
We have two factories ready to start manufacturing to meet the anticipated global demand, fuelled by a rapid global increase in diabetes and global vaccination programmes. To set the factory up, we need to arrange funding in the form of loans, convertible loans or sale of equity.","Problem
Diabetics injecting insulin currently use large cumbersome medical devices in the form of insulin pens and medical syringes (not designed for self injection) up to six times a day. The syringes are far from portable and attract attention when used in public places. The pens are portable but bulky, difficult to carry on the person, are easily broken and need to be refrigerated to preserve the insulin which degrades with heat.
Solution
We will bring our miniature injection device Minipen to the following markets:
- People with diabetes injecting insulin (Type 1 & 2)
- Cosmetic markets
- Medical vaccination & Immunisation programmes
- Veterinary Use
Manufacturing of the Minipen is due to begin in August 2021 subject to financing having been secured in January 2021.
We have a pipeline of 15 clients, two distributor’s have already signed contracts and we expect to sign by the end of January 2021.
We are seeking Trade Finance to fund 12 months of OPEX and the CAPEX required to set-up a production line with US Company Darco Corporation.
Details of the finance required can be found in a separate document  referenced as Debt Market Proposal.
Small investors can obtain shares in the Swedish company please ask for details.

Our sensors come in forms of labels possible to attach to the package and can show the level of freshness either visually directly on the label or through a digital system in your smartphone or a larger system if you are eg a retailer.","Currently about 19% of all meat produced is wasted before reaching the consumer and the negative environmental impact of this wasted part represents more than 1,5 times the emissions from the aviation industry. About 10% of the total waste in the meat industry can be derived from confusion or poor use of best before dates resulting in waste to a value of 20 billion USD annually on a global scale. Innoscentia develops smart sensors labels to help solve this.
The basis of the sensors is an ink with the ability to measure gas concentration within a food package. The gas concentration has a direct correlation with the bacterial growth and can therefore provide an indication of the freshness of the product.
The labels aim to prolong the shelf life of meat products and activate the full consumption period resulting in less waste. A prolonged shelf life of only 2 days could reduce retail waste with up to 50% and household waste with up to 60% which would result in massive benefits.",Malmö,"food tech, food waste, cleantech, innovation",,2015,www.innoscentia.com,,,SE
