We offer a plug-and-play solution for companies to easily quote, sell, design and install and certify heat pumps.","Nido is a startup dedicated to addressing a pressing environmental issue. Currently, 95% of homes rely on fossil fuels, generating over 40% of greenhouse emissions in the residential sector. And in the EU alone, there are 65 million gas boilers that have exceeded their useful lives.
There’s a much better product already available: heat pumps - a superior environmental solution that consumes 75% less energy than traditional boilers and operates on electricity rather than gas, offering both environmental benefits and cost savings. The European Commission has made rolling out heat pumps central to their 2030 climate targets, with countries implementing incentive schemes for heat pumps and prohibition measures for traditional boilers.
Despite this immense opportunity, only about 1 million heat pumps are being installed in Europe annually, significantly hindering our path to electrify Europe. And the opportunity is to install over 65m heat pumps which would equate to almost 1 Trillion Euro. This is where Nido comes in.
We've developed a software solution that addresses three critical challenges:
1. Mass scale adoption: We need to get new entrants offering heat pumps to their end consumers so we expand the pie. Given the technical complexity for this, Nido offer a plug-and-play solution for new entrants to start selling heat pumps to their customers with little training required. Our clients include energy, renewables, and construction companies.

Stark Future will swiftly become a reference in the off-road motorcycling sector: a segment that will be leading the charge in electric motorcycle progression.

Stark means ‘strong’ in Swedish: an attribute also symbolized by the Stark Future 24K gold ring, an icon representing a bold, full circle mentality, sustainability, and perfection.","Background
Stark Future was established in the first months of 2020 with Swedish roots and from founders with an immensely successful commercial presence in motocross and the motorcycle industry. Stark Future counts on an international foundation of staff and specialists from its base, on the doorstep of the progressive and forward-thinking city: Barcelona. Stark Future was forged from a passion to innovate and to change the way we use and interact with motorcycles. The company investigates and develops the latest technical solutions for performance, mobility, function, battery power, and sustainability.
Purpose
Stark Future’s primary ambition is to design, develop and manufacture cutting-edge electric motorcycles to push boundaries of performance and set new standards for sustainability in the industry. Stark Future will swiftly become a reference in the off-road motorcycling sector: a segment that will be leading the charge in electric motorcycle progression.   
Stark Future’s goal is to utilize the highest-grade material and components, creativity, and engineering for a premium concept to outshine contemporary and outdated combustion engine platforms. Our scientific studies have laid a base of knowledge that will allow the company to build models that will leave traditional technology in the ruts. 
Stark means ‘strong’ in Swedish: an attribute also symbolized by the Stark Future 24K gold ring, an icon representing a bold, full circle mentality, sustainability, and perfection. 
Technology
Stark Future’s first serial production motorcycle is the Stark VARG: the lightest, most powerful motocross bike in the world. The demands and requirements of off-road riding mean the Stark VARG has to be the most advanced, durable, versatile, and fun offer in the category, all the while paying full respect to the environment and conditions in which the bike is being used.
The Stark VARG is a beacon for some of the benchmark and patent-pending technology the company will bring to the market:
Ground-breaking motor, cooling, and battery architecture
A class-leading powertrain of 80hp at 9hp per kilogram
Ultra-small and light chassis concept with the use of premium materials such as carbon fiber, magnesium, and aero craft grade aluminum
Smartphone dash and motorcycle set-up APP
Bodywork that prioritizes ergonomics, comfort, and performance
Advanced suspension solutions from specialists KAYABA
A ride anywhere, anytime concept thanks to low maintenance, long-lasting battery with zero emissions and no noise
Stark Future is committed to a wide and versatile product range based on several of the technical milestones achieved with the Stark VARG.
Motocross
Swedish founder Anton Wass and his Co-founder Paul Soucy both began motocross and off-road riding at a very young age, both powered by determination, perseverance, and relentless self-improvement. A hobby and a passion soon became a successful business and then a forceful desire to use their recreation and achievements for positive change.
The Stark VARG (‘VARG’ meaning ‘wolf’) was introduced in the final quarter of 2021. It currently has six patents in the approval process. The model immediately set a new, high level of technical specifications and performance not only among the growing off-road electric bike field but the entire motocross spectrum. The Stark VARG mixed fierce output and power with easy handling, lengthy range, and full customization of the power train characteristics according to more than 100 different configurations, allowing the bike to assume the role of a 125cc two-stroke, 250, 350, 450, or thundering 500cc two-stroke with all the nimble agility and sharp riding sensations intact.
The Stark VARG boasts innovations such as the lightest chassis found in any adult-sized motocross bike and uses the electric motor as a structural part of the frame to trim weight, boost handling and optimize strength. The use of advanced KAYABA suspension enhances the off-road handling of the motorcycle, and the ergonomics generate the best feeling, stability, and confidence whatever the terrain, track, or conditions.
The company’s philosophy is based on three core values, values that have been immensely outlined for the initial model developed by the company:
1) Challenge the norm: Stark Future questions and rallies against the status quo of the way bikes and products are built. This mentality means the Stark Future technical team seeks every possible means to improve and develop a component using the full extent of their ingenuity as a quick, flexible, young, and motivated crew.
2) Setting clear objectives: Setting clear objectives: Stark Future was extremely concise about designing and producing an electric motocross bike to outperform all other combustion-engined MX motorcycles on the market.
3) Deliver outstanding results: Ideas and an inquisitive mentality can generate many promising solutions but without results the effort is pointless. The Stark VARG is the fruit of great labour and ingenuity and is a premium first statement by the company.   
Resources
Stark Future products are developed by an international technical team from various backgrounds, ranging from the prototype breeding ground of MotoGP to design studios and well-renowned manufacturers. The company’s brand-new R&D facilities and factory lines are based just outside of Barcelona, with initial distribution channels coming through online orders (delivered directly to the customer or dealerships) through the Stark website.
Stark Future utilizes the very latest computer-aided technology for its R&D processes, from full motorcycle CAD Design, simulations, 3D printing to virtual reality. The factory lines are built to house cutting-edge robot hardware for the intricate assembly of models such as the motocross flagship model, the Stark VARG.
The product department features an in-house laboratory to test material properties and construction techniques. To define the best possible development pathway of components the company benchmarks the best bikes and their performance in order to reach much higher levels in new, sustainable, electric technology. This approach means Stark Future ensures the highest quality and consistency for all its production phases. 
Expansion and next steps
While Stark Future continues to innovate, it remains true to its core ethos: pushing the boundaries to develop and create sustainable products that will outperform current non-sustainable options. Stark Future wants to contribute to creating a cleaner, healthier planet, where life is enriched and better for everyone, both today and in the future. Whilst producing advanced technology and products is a central attribute, the company’s ultimate goals are sustainability and the ongoing exploration of technical innovation. The company is powered by the pursuit to find new frontiers and create vehicles, solutions and experiences for people who want the ultimate in performance, design, convenience, and emotion.",Sant Boi de llobregat,"Motocross Bike, Electric Mx, Premium Electric Dirtbike, Electric Motorcycle",Above €25 million,2020,https://starkfuture.com/,Active,ES,https://www.linkedin.com/company/stark-future/

Robinsun Energy SL,https://www.eu-startups.com/directory/robinsun-energy-sl/,Spain,"Residential solar is all the rage. It delivers the cheapest energy to households and avoids using grid energy that is not renewable and very expensive. But can all households take advantage of the benefits of solar power?

Just 50% of Europeans live in a house with a roof on which they can install solar panels. Everybody else lives in apartments that have no roof for a solar installation. In Southern Europe, where solar energy works best, 60-65% of households live in apartments. Robinsun brings the advantages of cheap solar energy to this unserved majority.

Installing solar panels on your balcony or pergola is easier and cheaper than you think. A 21st century Robin Hood would definitely fit his balcony with a Plug & Play Solar Kit, would stop paying huge power bills and would go get a subsidy from the sheriff.

Likewise, today’s Robinson Crusoe would have generated solar energy on his balcony a long time ago, heading over to the nearest DIY store to get components and build himself a Plug & Play Solar Kit. And he would not be asking for permits.

Robinsun is a European tech company based in Madrid. We develop innovative renewable energy products that combine proven technologies with mass market applications.

Robinsun was founded by Boris Hageney, a veteran entrepreneur in eCommerce in Europe and the US. Boris' main motivation to found Robinsun was the desire to build a scalable consumer tech company that participates in the fight against climate change. Every Plug & Play Solar Kit we sell is a small step in our common goal: to decarbonize the energy we use, and save our planet.

A company is only as good as its people. In our HQ an international and purpose-driven team is working hard to grow Robinsun, improve the products and services we deliver to our customers, and get customers on board with our mission. If you like what we do, you might want to join us.

Robinsun was born to contribute to the fight against climate change. We help households decarbonize the energy they consume. Also as a company, Robinsun commits to a net zero footprint.

From the energy we consume, to our company policies on travel and office space, as well as our packaging and logistics efforts, we measure our footprint and offset the inevitable. We will report on our progress on a regular basis.",,Madrid,"Solar, renewable energy, solar plug & play kits, solar balcony kits",Between €1-€100K,2023,robinsun.com,Active,ES,

How does it help brands?
Onlive.site can be integrated into a brand’s website to sell through video in two new formats: “one-to-many” group sales (live shopping) or a private “one-to-one” model (personal shopper): 
·	The “one-to-many” format (or live shopping) isa live event for many spectators where a host presents the products or services. The audience watches the show as if a TV programe except they can buy any of the products shown. Thus, the audience and the live shopping host interact through chat, likes, surveys, games and even by inviting someone from the audience to participate in the show. 
·	“One-to-one” is ideal for high value-added products. In other words, a washing machine, a car, electronics, a computer, a mattress or anything that needs another person on the other side to close the sale and where the buyer is confident enough to buy. “It’s difficult to buy certain things with a flat web without anyone on the other side. Why would I buy a diamond through a website? But, if I’ve got a personal shopper; in other words, someone in the know, and they show it to me on camera, explains certain things, answers my questions and I can see the warranties... then I just might do it,” defends Alfredo.",Barcelona,"live shopping, video shopping, livestream shopping",No funding announced yet,2021,https://onlive.site,,ES,

We are going to solve the two main barriers that make the adoption of regenerative agriculture models so difficult. The first is the lack of knowledge about how to do a transition to a better and more sustainable model by the first involved, the farmers. And the second is the declining farm profitability across Europe.
Agriculture is complex. Knowing which is the best way to make a transition to a regenerative model, which steps are necessary to implement that change and in what order do they work best is critical. The AI analysis would provide a good road map to focus in each case and a forecast of the amount of money the farmers would earn by carbon removal credits. For that it is crucial to have a better way to monitor the increase of SOC and follow up what practices restore better the health of the soil in each case. With that we are going to break the two main barriers and farmers will have a secure way to adapt their farms to the climate change, increasing their incomes.
Our clients are going to be the companies that want to offset their emissions. We will sell them the carbon removal credits that the farmers, thanks to Azolla Projects, would be able to produce. We will keep a percentage of that money and the rest will go directly to the farmers. Those credits are going to have a huge value for RSC and marketing purposes because this process has a lot of benefits, beyond the compensation. By buying them you can give back money to the same area where your company is developing its activity, and you will also be increasing biodiversity, putting a stop on soil degradation, slowing the dangerous desertification and so on.
Once we have the early adopters and our technology is robust, the farmers will pay a fee for entering the program and we will sale our services to other agricultural advisors (SaaS).",Barcelona,"CarbonFarming, MRV, Climatechange, RegenerativeAgriculture",No funding announced yet,2020,https://www.azollaprojects.com/,,ES,

IZI RECORD,https://www.eu-startups.com/directory/izi-record/,Spain,"A new revenue stream for musicians based on a Freemium service for their audience. It works like this: a) Groups of friends record a HiFi video together and share it on social media. The sponsor pays a small fee to add a splash screen, and the musicians receives 51% of the revenue b) Groups of friends want the video with no adds: they pay a fee and 51% goes to the musician.
IZI wants to enhance audience experience in live concerts and generate a new revenue stream for musicians. The enhancement come through an APP that improves recordings during the performance with the usage of a MULTICAM system that share everyone's recordings. The APP will smash it, personalize it and add the audiotrack from the mixer desk. 2 clicks and you can share a unique video everyone. The new revenue stream comes from the income generated through the APP. 51% goes to the artists. We generate the income based on a FREEMIUM model where the user pays for a non-adds experience, 2€, otherwise the sponsor dos it. This tech will be applied also in sports events, congress, weddings, etc,...","The evolution of the music sector in recent years has caused revenues from sales of digital albums or albums to decline. This fact has also polarized the sector, with a small group of musicians who make millionaire income through the consumption of streaming music, and a large number of musicians who do not get enough income to make a living from it. This has meant that, until 2019, the main source of income for the vast majority of musicians was live performances. In 2020, due to COVID, this source of income has also been decimated. In Catalonia, COVID has caused an 80% reduction in concerts in 2020, 94% of spectators and 87% of turnover.
There is, therefore, a clear need in the music sector for a solution that allows musicians to reconnect with their audience, and generate a source of income for them.
The IZI application provides a simple answer to some of the challenges of the contemporary music industry, and specifically, of live music. The main attraction is that it allows users to easily obtain a souvenir of a concert in the form of a Premium video that combines great video and audio quality with personalization, It also allows music fans and major music brands support your favorite musicians.
This is possible thanks to the technological innovation that IZI brings to the market:
1. Deep Learning techniques for the automatic analysis of video scenes (computer vision) together with a proprietary system based on machine learning (deep learning) used to provide an automatic video editing system. The automated video editing system AVE (Automated Video Edition) is based on LSTM (Long Short Term Memory) architectures. The AVE system selects which of a set of synchronized video takes should be selected, to create a video of a predefined duration that combines the contributions of different takes.
The system combines automated classification techniques (first self-supervised, then semi-supervised) for the analysis of video scenes together with conditioning learning techniques (Reinforcement Learning) to individually personalize the videos based on feedback. that gives the user to the system proposals.
2. An audio analysis service that combines an event detection system based on deep learning systems (CNNs). This allows the detection and location (auto-tagging) in time of the most relevant sound events, which informs both the synchronization and the automatic editing of videos. Likewise, an audio source separation module allows not only segmenting sound sources but also extracting the acoustics of the event (i.e. the reverb), thereby achieving a high-quality audio mix.
3. Innovative strategies for adaptive streaming techniques and video source synchronization protocols
4. A very careful design of experience (UX)
To understand our business strategy well, it is important to distinguish the benefits of the different players:
• The user is the audience attending the concert. You get:
A. A high quality video that combines the videos provided by the musician together with the recordings that the user and his friends have made during the concert
B. A unique video, personalized for him
C. High-quality audio in your videos, provided by the musician
• The ambassador of the application is the musician. We want them to be our main promoters. Because IZI is the first APP that was born to support live music. The musician gets:
A. All media content generated by him and by users
B. A substantial part of the turnover (51%).
• The client is the user (B2C model) or the sponsor of the event (B2B model). In the B2C model the user pays for
A. To be able to keep the videos that he has generated and share them on his social networks (and
B. Support his favorite musicians.

T. +34 932 075 356/636060266

• In the B2B model, the sponsor pays for
A. an advertising space in the videos that users generate and share for free through their social networks (multiplicative effect of sponsorship)
B. Your association with a service to support your favorite artists and a memorable experience
C. Accurate metrics on the digital impact on social media
Importantly, this solution also allows musicians to earn income from online concerts. For this, both musicians and users are recorded with the IZI application, and this allows you to very easily create Premium videos that combine both in a lasting memory of an online event. The income associated with these videos is distributed in a majority (51%) to the musician who organizes the concert.
We have currently completed the design of the application, the branding and the commercial strategy. We are working intensively to complete the Minimum Viable Product and begin pilot testing in the first months of 2021.
The grant provided by Startup Capital will contribute substantially to the growth phase (€ 75K of the € 156K planned).
Specifically, it will allow us to accelerate the sales process, which will allow us to scale to a sufficient size to close our first sponsorships in the B2B model. The impact of this grant will translate into:

We are three passionate vegans who would like to help people become vegan easily. There are many vegan food delivery Startups but what we do differently is to cook fresh vegan meals everyday and deliver to people. Also, for us vegan food is a not an alternative to meat but it has its own class.
We deliver 100% organic, ecological and vegan meals. Our recipes are inspired by Indian cuisine which is traditionally delicious. We use hand made and home made spices to bring a exquisite flavour. 
VFC offers different menus every days. A meal basically consists of three components - Base, Salsa and Compliments. 
We are opening our first club in Valencia where the awareness of plant based food has grown exponentially. We have logistics partners like Muving, Food App partner Mr. Noow and Ingredients Partner like Flora, an Upfield/Unilever company.
From growing vegetables till packaging and delivering food, we are 100% ecological. Our meal boxes are made by sugarcane bagasse and is compostable. 
We also use materials made by local providers to help the local economy. 
We want to make vegan go mainstream and easily available. Our meal prices depend on locations but we managed to cut cost by following agile logistic method inspired by Mumbai Tiffinwalas. Please Howard Business Review's article on Mumbais Model of Service Excellence .
We need €3 per customer to start operation of our vegan kitchens. We have researched that in Spain there are 96 thousand prospects which are ready to consume plant based meal. According to Lantern.es, one out of every ten Spanish woman is a 'Veggie', a term for a person who relies on plant based meals.
So to reach the population of 100K potential vegan food consumers, we need €300,000. 
We are looking forward to expand our presence in other major European cities such a Berlin, London, etc. For that, we would love to launched a local GoFundMe campaign per city.

cleanSpot,https://www.eu-startups.com/directory/cleanspot-your-nearest-recycling-spot/,Spain,"cleanSpot is a digital platform that improves the waste sorting facilitating the information about how, where and when we can recycle the waste we genetare in our day-to-day. It also provides useful integrated services to citizens such as alerts and information services from your favourite cities/towns, list of waste pickup services in your area, geolocated awareness-raising campaigns and a virtual card service where citizens can accumulate reward points each time they recycle.","On average, each European produces 500Kg of household waste per year and only 40% of them are recycled or reused. EU target for recycling 65% of waste and reduce landfill to maximum of 10% of municipal waste by 2030 and 600Mt of material pontencially recyclable with a value of 5,000M€ are lost.
One of the biggest problem is the lack of information or very hard to find it about how and where to recycle any waste we produce in our day-to-day life. cleanSpot helps you to locate the recycling spots in your city where you can drop off properly the waste we generate in our day-to-day such as batteries, consumer electronics, mobile phones, light bulbs, used oil, clothes and shoes, furniture, toys, books and school supplies, coffee capsules, etc. These recycling spots consist of reuse and recycling centres, mobile recycling centres, drop off points, recycling and specialized bins, charity shops, etc. And all of them in an unique app in your mobile phone or tablet. Also we can easily reach citizenship thanks to our integrated services such as alerts and information services from your favourite cities/towns, list of waste pickup services in your area, geolocated awareness-raising campaigns.
Another problem is the lack of motivation. 4 out of 10 people do not recycle for fear of being wrong and this means a cost of 125M€ per year. The approach Pay-As-You-Throw is being used in some European areas and follows “polluter pays principle” but the transition to this scheme is still complex and high cost. A mixed scheme with a municipal waste management fix charging but this amount being reduced by discounts per recycling could be applied. These discounts also could be offered by Circular Economy and Second Hand entities in order to increase their waste collections. cleanSpot provides a virtual card service where citizens can accumulate reward points each time they recycle. Those rewards points can be redeemed by discounts in municipal taxes or voucher to be used in local stores.
Our goal is cleanSpot being used as public service to citizenship to encourage recycling and reuse, helps to the fight agains Climate Change and contributes to Circular Economy and local businesses. Furthermore, our solution is aligned with 2030 Agenda and Sustainable Development Goals 11, 12 and 13.",Málaga,"recycle,waste,reuse,sustainability",No funding announced yet,2020,https://cleanspotapp.com/en/index.html,,ES,

Predictheon,https://www.eu-startups.com/directory/predictheon/,Spain,"The ideas behind Predictheon started in 2015 when a group of medical doctors, anesthesiologists to be specific, together with math modelers, and computer engineers decided to move forward their prior research track. The original goal was to create a new concept in patient care management, one that seeks to integrate predictive analytics with real-time monitoring, in order to give clinicians meaningful information about a patient’s future behavior. Such information would allow an anesthesia provider to anticipate a clinically significant change, or possibly an upcoming negative event before it occurs. This concept arose from the desire to better understand how the current state of the patient will change in the next 5 or 10 minutes from now, allowing the anesthesia provider to proactively act ahead of time, to prevent a potentially severe adverse side effect before it happens. The concept expanded to other areas of healthcare where we are actively searching for predictive solutions (perioperative blood management, altered postoperative cognition, critical care, oncology, …). Predictheon was created as a company in 2019.
We verified our idea by continuously collecting ""outcome-oriented"" high-resolution data from a vast number of patients, analyzing those data under a population perspective, using classical modeling or AI-derived methods, and have now come up with a powerful “predictive engine” based on mathematical models describing the relations between patients and outcomes. When we apply our unique solution to a new patient, our models can predict future behavior, including potentially severe side effects before they happen. Predictheon's individualized patient care now results in optimal decision making and increased patient safety during a medical procedure that requires the patient to have sedation or general anesthesia and will expand into other areas of patient care.",,Barcelona,"Health Care, Medical, Medical Device, Software",No funding announced yet,2019,https://www.predictheon.com/,,ES,

Hedyla is a start-up focused on applying Big Data and Artificial Intelligence techniques in the logistics sector (warehousing and transport) to provide new insights that help to make better decisions and optimize operations in the day-to-day, operational level, and the strategic level. 
To do that, we offer a product in the cloud, easy to use and integrate, so logistic operations need to do as less work as possible. The platform connects to their existing systems, extracts data, combines and analyses it using the latest techniques to provide with predictions, actions to optimize the operations, comparatives of warehouses, and detection of anomalies, amongst many others.
The product will provide a dashboard with the relevant information, easy to use and understand, but also will allow the customer to export all the data to perform their own analysis. Furthermore, our product will be able to connect to their existing systems not only to retrieve information, but also to make actions such as planing the operators tasks using our analysis and predictions.
Our advantage lies in the use of technologies easy to integrate without significative changes in the facilities of the customers, with a fast deployment and a minimal investment in time and money. Other solutions that obtain information from the warehouse, including movement of operations use expensive, dedicated hardware, and do not combine data from different systems.
Our goal is to improve and extend our platform to manage all the logistic processes of the companies of the sector, growing our capacity to interact with their IT systems and creating new analysis techniques that give metrics even more informative.

Our story began 5 years ago, when Ramon was studying music in Berlin. At that time he was sharing a small flat with 2 other musicians and began learning how to play the saxophone.
""It was a disaster trying to practice my horn in a small flat. I bothered my colleagues and neighbours so much that I had to start practicing outside, in the parks. But when the winter came, it was to cold to practice so I understood that I had to create something that could help me practice anytime and anywhere""  (Ramon Mañas).
From there onwards, we have been obsessed creating the smallest and lightest electronic saxophone in the world, to help saxophonist to practice and play silently when and wherever they want without disturbing others.

We provide full service lead management for solar projects from 1 household, to multiple solar installation projects from 10-80 households at once.
We connect the supply and demand for solar energy systems with households and installers. What makes us unique is that we, besides creating an optimized lead generation tool, implement a solar subscription. In collaboration with (green) investors, banks and ajuntaments, we create the opportunity to outroll instant sustainability projects. We are in close contact with ajuntaments that directly want assistance with making their city more sustainable. We organize an event in the ajuntaments with potential/interested clients, do a local marketing campaign and find the right investment. We aim at installing between 20-80 installations (€90.000-€300.000) at once (which can be seen as 1 project, 1 investment source is needed). In combination with the right grants, we realize payback times of 5 years (with a guaranteed pay of the subscribers).
Our contract takes into account any possible cancelation or buy-backs. Our model guarantees payments of clients and assures investors for the payment of the loan.
In collaboration with Ajuntaments, we evaluate the solar potential and sustainability goals of the city based on the following points:
Number of potential households
Number of interested people/families
Local Grants:
On the total installation budget (up to 50% of total price sin IVA)
On state taxes (IBI and ICIO, respectively 50% for 3 years and 95%)

Balio is an app that creates a personalized plan to achieve financial goals (for example, a quiet retirement, a mortgage entrance fee) within a friendly, gamified and automated environment.
The process is as follows:
The user registers and connects their accounts through a secure banking aggregation system. From there, it defines a financial goal, and our algorithms calculate how long it will take to achieve it at their current rate of income and expenses, proposing a simple savings and investing plan.

It is our objective that our tools are easy to use and approachable by non-technical people. We want people to benefit from automation tools even if they cannot easily host their own open source code, build their own backtesting or build a profitable trading strategy on their own (or don't have the time for it).
The crypto expectations of ""HODL"" and ""lambos"" are not only unreasonable but also a result of a lack of education from the crypto community, often encouraged by influencers and scammers. It is true that some people might become very rich by just buying some lucky coins and holding them long term but that should not serve as an example for others. We want Airbag to help people be more educated about the concept of investment, volatility and risk management, and that's why we optimize for Sharpe Ratio (Return/Risk), not just returns. If we have a lower return than HODL, but at a much lower volatility and exposure, then we are happy, and we hope our users to be happy too. And if things go south and we can avoid losses for our users, even better. We aim to educate our users about risk in the context of crypto over time.
Our technology is based on neural networks that use different technical and fundamental inputs to produce outputs in the form of expected returns and volatility every time period. We have built our own exchange, backtesting simulation engines and real time data feeds.

Befundo,https://www.eu-startups.com/directory/befundo/,Spain,"Befundo.com is a website where users find a property portal, a marketplace, a job portal and a local company directory to browse freelancers or find local services. When it comes to successfull online advertising, it's all about 'being found' on the already digital overcrowded highway. With so many nowadays possibilities, how to make the difference?

Let us first explain you what we do: Befundo offers an unique user-friendly way regarding information provision. The Befundo team has studied the most common search behaviour of people on the internet. We came to the conclusion that over 70% of all people using the internet every day look for searchterms such as; properties, market places to buy or sell things, find a new job, looking for local businesses such as finding a painter or plumber, information about cities and weather forecasts. All search terms and topics have basically nothing to do with each other and are one by one individual. That’s why we already find large and well-known companies and websites on the market such as Amazon, Zillow, Rightmove and Airbnb offering one of these search related subjects. Befundo, on the other hand, went on a quest to find out how all these components could be connected and whether there would be a need for it. That need is indeed there. Imagine how easy it would be if you live in Amsterdam and are looking for a job in another city, say Madrid. You can go to Befundo to see if there are any vacancies in Madrid available. For the sake of convenience, let's say that there is a vacancy that suits you completely, what now? On most other websites you can respond, send your resume, then wait until you get a response and there it’s ending. However, at Befundo, you can quickly and efficiently also find out whether there is housing available in Madrid for you and which products (new and second hand) are offered for sale in the area, if you need a bed or couch, for example. Does the house you have in mind in Madrid also have to be painted? You can also find that information in no time at Befundo. Not only information about the available vacancy, but also current housing supply, information about the city, local companies, services and what is offered for sale is easy to find on Befundo. Befundo has succeeded as a pioneer in perfectly integrating the most used searched terms on the internet with the aim of providing consumers with the most important information without switching between different websites of different providers. If consumers know how to find their way to Befundo, then advertisers do so also. We can state with certainty that every local advertiser enjoys global recognition with us. Only then have succeeded in connecting consumers and providers!

Well, that's how we improve our user experiences every single day. But Befundo.com is not only about our users. In the end we need to satisfy both users as our advertisers. As a fast growing company Befundo.com won several startup competetions and succeeded in Angel funding and Series A. At this moment we openend our funding in Series B. The way we keep advertisers happy, is the way that advertising is only paid by results PA's resulting in PL's. We have the highest CPL per visitor on today's portal market. Is there any explanation for? Because users like to visit Befundo.com and like the way we provide them from clean, clear up to date information. We drive target audience to our website and while browsing our website we will take you on one big digital adventure.

Befundo.com uses colourfull happy colours and the way we express ourself, we share those emotions with our users. This results in actions and actions results in leads. With every module on our website we offer advertisers an easy to use but powerfull CRM platform, so you can stay close connected from your Befundo.com dashboard with your clients and keep them interested for all your services and products.

For investors we offer interesting investment packages with an ROI of 12.8% (guaranteed) yearly if you join our investment round in SERIES B,C or D. Not only we offer you every year your ROI percentage, but if you are sick and tired having a Befundo.com share after 3 years we buy your share back.

Already holding the worldwide patent.,"We are Skroller, a Spanish start-up that has developed a disruptive device that works as a backrest for e-scooters that provides stablity and comfort during the ride, drastically reducing the risk of accidents.
Like the saddle on a horse, the e-scooter needed something that enhanced the rider's comfort, stability, and control. Resigning ourselves to sore legs, back pain and the immediate loss of stability and control at the slightest road crack was definitely not 'smart mobility'. Both new and experienced riders were longing for a device that reduced body strain and enhances control avoiding clumsy back-seats.
Fortunately, this device has arrived and it's called Skroller!.
Skroller connects your body to the pole of the scooter enabling it as the center of balance. That's right, you can now shift your weight to the sides while turning so that the riding feels smoother and safer, feeling in control of each turn, even when hands-free!
Skroller works by means of a band with a comfy cushion that you can easily fasten around your waist. The internal mechanism is designed to retrieve the band automatically as you get closer to the pole, so you can confidently lean back, relax and adjust it on-the-go by simply pressing the button on top of Skroller, as you no longer need both hands to keep balance.
This opens up a whole new world of possibilities only restrained by your fantasy. Common actions that seemed impossible and dangerous while riding without Skroller, like wearing an umbrella, signalling a turn or even juggling are now at will, in a comfortable and easy way.
To achieve the functionalities needed while guaranteeing the best performance and endurance, we have engineered Skroller using the latest materials in the market. Making it incredibly resistant to any type of efforts or shocks.
Last but not least, Skroller is fully customizable! You can choose the color of almost any part ( body, button, cushion...) check out our picks at our ( successfully completed) Kickstarter campaign
Regardless of how you commute, we encourage you to let us embrace you while riding the Skroller wave and back our project here.

Currently, 95% of homes rely on fossil fuels, generating over 40% of greenhouse emissions in the residential sector. And in the EU alone, there are 65 million gas boilers that have exceeded their useful lives.
There’s a much better product already available: heat pumps - a superior environmental solution that consumes 75% less energy than traditional boilers and operates on electricity rather than gas, offering both environmental benefits and cost savings. The European Commission has made rolling out heat pumps central to their 2030 climate targets, with countries implementing incentive schemes for heat pumps and prohibition measures for traditional boilers.
Despite this immense opportunity, only about 1 million heat pumps are being installed in Europe annually, significantly hindering our path to electrify Europe. And the opportunity is to install over 65m heat pumps which would equate to almost 1 Trillion Euro. This is where Nido comes in.
We've developed a software solution that addresses three critical challenges:
1. Mass scale adoption: We need to get new entrants offering heat pumps to their end consumers so we expand the pie. Given the technical complexity for this, Nido offer a plug-and-play solution for new entrants to start selling heat pumps to their customers with little training required. Our clients include energy, renewables, and construction companies.
2.Installation capacity:  We need to expand capacity of the current installers as this is a bottleneck. For this Nido created an automated engineering solution for installers to easily quote, design, and procure materials required for their jobs, making them three times more efficient.
3.Technology trust: Of the heat pumps currently being installed, there is little oversight to whether the work is done correctly and using the budgeted materials/equipment leading to poor quality. We created an automated quality assurance system that uses image processing to evaluate the quality of the work and provide feedback to the craftsmen.",MAdrid,"Heat Pumps, SaaS, 3D automation",Between €2.5 million-5 million,2023,https://www.gonido.com/,Active,ES,https://www.linkedin.com/company/gonido/?viewAsMember=true
