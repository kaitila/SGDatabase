It helps analog shooters keep track of the essential details behind every photo, such as camera settings, lens, film stock, location, and personal notes. Instead of juggling paper logs or repurposed note apps, photographers can now rely on a clean, intuitive interface designed just for their workflow.
Many film photographers develop a deep connection with their tools and process, but remembering the context of each shot weeks later can be difficult. Frames solves this by making it quick and natural to log information while shooting. Once the film is processed and scanned, these notes can be embedded into the final images as standard metadata, giving digital files the same rich context as their analog origins.
The app runs on iOS and macOS, with sync support through iCloud. Users can access their records across devices without worrying about vendor lock-in or hidden data collection. Frames is privacy-friendly, storing data locally by default and never collecting personal information.
Out of the box, the app includes a library of over 200 popular film stocks, and users can add their own. Cameras, lenses, and films can be saved as presets for quick access. Smart autofill features reduce repetitive entry, while map integration allows for tagging frames by shooting location. Notes can be grouped into folders, and final images can be exported with full metadata included.
Frames is the work of Vincent Tantardini, an independent designer and photographer who built the app to support his own creative workflow. It reflects a strong respect for analog photography while offering modern conveniences that stay true to the craft.
Whether you are documenting everyday life or building a detailed archive of your creative process, Frames helps you stay organized without interrupting the flow of shooting on film. It brings clarity and context to every frame, giving photographers a better way to bridge the gap between analog and digital.","Paris, France","film, photography, analog, app",No funding announced yet,2025,https://withframes.com/,Active,FR,http://linkedin.com/company/withframes/

To give control back to the creators, the innovators, the businesses built on originality. Instead, it’s done the opposite.
The very systems designed to support growth have become the chains that hold brands back. Marketplaces, platforms, and third-party solutions demand more—more data, more margins, more power—while giving less. The result? Founders become dependent. Margins shrink. The brands that built the industry become collateral damage, while the investors and platforms take the upside.
At Almond Labs, we believe in a different way. We are independent. Built by Studio Almond and focused on lifestyle brands who refuse to be boxed in.
We built Roadmap, our no-code Shopify toolkit, because we saw how brands were being held back. Instead of one-off fixes and expensive custom development, we develop solutions that work across businesses—so brands can access high-performance features without the overhead.
We consult because we know that technology alone isn’t enough. Success comes from strategy, from insights, from a partner who sees beyond the build to what really drives growth.

High-scoring candidates are invited for an interview conducted by an AI-powered virtual
interviewer. Following the interview, another detailed report is generated to assess candidate
responses and provide further insights into their skills and suitability for the position.
This system aims to automate and streamline the hiring process, allowing companies to save
time and improve the quality of candidate selection.
Problem:
Haier addresses the major challenges of traditional recruitment:
● High Volume of Applications: Recruiters spend significant time sorting through
hundreds of CVs for each job posting, with an average ratio of 250 applications per hire.
● Time-Consuming Screening: Conducting numerous pre-screening interviews,
averaging 10 interviews per hire, is repetitive, inefficient, and prone to human error and
unconscious bias.
By automating these processes, our platform reduces the number of applications to review and
interviews to conduct, improving recruitment efficiency, quality, and cost-effectiveness.
Solution:
Haier utilizes AI to automate critical recruitment processes:
● Automated CV Analysis: Our algorithm rapidly analyzes resumes, identifying key skills
and qualifications, eliminating unconscious bias and human error.
● Detailed Reports and Skill Visualizations: Each candidate is assessed on their
strengths and weaknesses, providing recruiters with clear and actionable insights.
● Automated Virtual Interviews: AI-powered virtual interviewers conduct standardized
assessments, reducing the need for in-person interviews and improving efficiency.

By analyzing key components such as the processor (CPU), graphics processing unit (GPU), random access memory (RAM), and screen resolution, it can assess the degree of performance matching between these hardware elements. The core function of the bottleneck calculator is to compare the performance capabilities of these components to determine the efficiency of their collaborative operation. For instance, if a CPU’s processing speed cannot keep up with the data processing demands of the GPU, or if the RAM capacity is insufficient for the current data processing tasks, the bottleneck calculator can pinpoint these bottlenecks and suggest possible solutions.
However, it is important to note that the results provided by the bottleneck calculator are not entirely precise, as factors such as software optimization, thermal throttling, and manufacturing variances can all affect actual performance. Additionally, with updates to software or drivers, the assessment of system performance can change over time, highlighting the necessity for continuous monitoring and adjustment. Despite these limitations, the bottleneck calculator remains a valuable reference, offering PC users a starting point to understand potential bottleneck issues and to conduct more in-depth research or manual testing before considering hardware upgrades or system configuration adjustments.",Paris,Calculator,No funding announced yet,2024,https://bottleneck-calculator.net/,Active,FR,

At EggOn Technology, we understand that frustration often sparks the most transformative innovations. Our journey began with a simple observation: businesses, especially law firms, were struggling to maximize the potential of their technological investments. Remote collaborative work, alongside the technology and culture surrounding it, is here to stay. Analysts predict that managing remote workers and the accompanying technologies will be key business drivers through to 2024. However, technology alone won't solve these challenges – user adoption is critical.
Embracing the Challenge
The pandemic has forever changed the landscape of work. Prior to 2020, the concept of digital nomads and remote work seemed like a fringe trend. But as circumstances forced a global shift to remote working, businesses faced unprecedented challenges. Traditional methods of organizational change management, live training, and executive sponsorship proved inadequate for a dispersed workforce juggling personal and professional responsibilities at home. This frustration was the catalyst for our mission at EggOn Technology: to turn these challenges into opportunities for innovation.
Revolutionizing E-Learning for Law Firms
Our innovative solution for law firms is a secure, AI-driven e-learning platform that empowers users and legal teams to eliminate frustrations, work faster, and enhance efficiency. At the heart of this platform is our personalized virtual assistant, Chatbot nOg. Chatbot nOg provides seamless integration, real-time training support, proactive engagement, and multilingual capabilities, making it an invaluable tool for modern legal practices.
Our Philosophy
At EggOn Technology, we believe that to truly drive technology adoption, it’s essential to align new solutions with clear, measurable business outcomes. Our approach goes beyond just implementing technology. We focus on understanding the unique needs of each organization and its users. By setting realistic business goals and creating tailored adoption programs, we ensure that our solutions deliver tangible improvements in performance, cost reduction, risk management, and time savings.
Continuous Improvement and Engagement
We recognize that technology and user needs are constantly evolving. That's why we maintain an ongoing dialogue with our clients, regularly updating and refining our solutions to meet changing demands. By integrating feedback loops into our software, we enable users to directly communicate their needs and suggest new features, ensuring our technology remains relevant and effective.
Unlocking Productivity and Reducing Stress
With Chatbot nOg, legal teams gain instant answers, access to training materials, and invaluable in-house support, which unlocks productivity and reduces stress. This personalized virtual assistant adapts to the needs of each user, providing a tailored learning experience that makes complex tasks simpler and more manageable. By offering real-time support and proactive engagement, Chatbot nOg helps users stay ahead in a fast-paced legal environment.
Leadership and User Buy-In
Successful adoption of new technology requires strong leadership and user engagement. Our management team plays a crucial role in this process, demonstrating the benefits of our solutions and fostering a culture of innovation. By highlighting the tangible benefits of change, we help organizations move beyond resistance and embrace new ways of working.
Looking Ahead
As we look to the future, EggOn Technology remains committed to transforming frustration into innovation. We are dedicated to helping businesses navigate the complexities of remote work, leveraging technology to create more efficient, secure, and productive environments. Our goal is to empower our clients to achieve their business objectives and thrive in an ever-changing world.

These power lines and pipelines are critical to the proper functioning of our society. And they have to be inspected at regular intervals (sometimes several times a month) to ensure their good condition and prevent failures.
Today, these inspections are carried out with vehicles that emit high levels of greenhouse gases. The HyLighter is able to carry out these inspections more accurately, more safely for human beings and with 0 greenhouse gas emissions in flight.
Beyond this direct avoidance of emissions, our greatest impact lies in the data we collect.
Because, by making inspections more efficient, the HyLighter enables the detection of previously uncollected data. Indeed, large scale methane leak detection is now viable! These leaks on oil and gas infrastructures account for 4% of global greenhouse gas emissions. Yet, operators can repair them. But to repair them, they must be identified.

Vitademia,https://www.eu-startups.com/directory/vitademia/,France,"A cloud academy enabling students of life to learn fundamental life skills and wisdom, guided by retirees rich in life experiences, acting as their coaches and mentors.","In March 2020, I came up with the idea to empower retirees by enabling them to act as life coaches and mentors to their younger peers, who are seeking for answers to help them grow and overcome life challenges. 
In current society, the two most vulnerable age groups are young people in their 20s and senior citizens in retirement, with loneliness being one of the root problems.
For the younger generation, social media has consumed a significant portion of their daily communication with others, meaning people are talking less in real life than before. This leads to severe self-isolation and quite often the inability to find the right answers to hurdle the many obstacles we face during our life journey. With multigenerational households becoming less and less common, particularly in developed countries, sharing knowledge and wisdom between different age groups is becoming severely stunted. 
For the elder generation, this also has significant impact in the sense that they feel less and less purposeful in society after retirement. Retirees often feel left behind and share a sense of abandonment if they are not digitally competent. This is not to say they are isolated, because retirement homes and communities have been rapidly growing. However, this segregation by age is having a negative impact on society, as intergenerational communication and understanding are being stifled, day by day.
To sum this all up, generation gaps have never grown so rapidly in human history amid the exponential growth in technology. However, I strongly believe that we can lessen this gap by doing the following:
- building more communication channels between the young and old
- showing more appreciation for wisdom and knowledge gained through life experiences
- empowering retirees with essential skill set to communicate effectively in the digital age
Vitademia aims to provide a library of e-learning courses that tackle some of life's most difficult challenges. These courses would be developed by retirees who provide their wisdom in written form. Learners can ""study"" these courses at their own time online, whilst being guided by a team of dedicated coaches and mentors who specialise in the given subject. Coaching and mentoring sessions will take place online using video conferencing tools such as Skype, Google Hangouts or Zoom.",Montpellier,"coach, mentor, skills, wisdom",,2020,https://egonwong.wixsite.com/vitademia,,FR,

Symfony,https://www.eu-startups.com/directory/symfony/,France,"Symfony at a Glance
A PHP framework
In order to better understand what a framework is, let’s leave the world of computer science for a moment and imagine a mountaineering adventure. Developing an application is very similar to climbing a rock wall: you are at the bottom (you have an application to be created) and you need to reach the summit (and be pleased with the achievement of designing an application that works perfectly.)

If no one has ever climbed the wall in question, you will have to get by on your own: testing routes, occasionally backtracking so that you don’t get stuck in a corner, driving in pitons, etc. In contrast, if the wall has already been conquered, those who have gone before you will already have done this trial and error work, opening up possible paths (the frame) and installing the tools that will facilitate the climb (your work).

Basically, a framework consists of:

A toolbox - a set of prefabricated, rapidly integrate software components. This means that you will have to write less code, with less risk of error. This also means greater productivity and the ability to devote more time to doing those things which provide greater added value, such as managing guiding principles, side effects, etc.
A methodology – an “assembly diagram” for applications. A structured approach may seem to constrain at first. But in reality, it allows developers to work both efficiently and effectively on the most complex aspects of a task, and the use of Best Practices guarantees the stability, maintainability, and upgradeability of the applications you develop.
And although it might be obvious, we thought it best to say it anyway – Symfony is a PHP framework, which means that it permits web applications to be built in PHP!

A philosophy
What could be more useful than an application developed by users for their own needs? This is the story of the genesis of Symfony – born from the imagination of the web designers at SensioLabs, a web developer in its own right. Symfony was made available to everyone under an Open Source license. This benefits other developers, who also have the ability to improve it by adding their own modules.

Founded by 5 partners with more than 10 years of experience in exploring the subsoil and member of various organizations in the sector such as the Société Géologique de France and the EAGE. 45-8 Energy wishes to promote the establishment of a local supply chain in order to considerably reduce the environmental impact of current activity. The places where helium is consumed do not coincide with its production areas, therefore the objective of 45-8 Energy is to satisfy, in an eco-committed manner, a European market completely dependent on imports. The integration of this project on the territory is also facilitated by the support of GEFISS and the Chair in Mineral Industry and Territory of which 45-8 Energy is a member.
Exploring the underground for helium is a new activity in Europe. In this sense, 45-8 Energy is positioning itself as a pioneer company in the sector.

In addition to this main activity, 45-8 Energy is carrying out R&D work necessary for the design of efficient tools suitable for the detection of helium and hydrogen in the near surface.

YesWeShare is the 360° sharing platform contributing to social link and individual well-being at work, fostering belonging and engagement between employees.","12.600  : thats the cost of unhappiness at work per employee each year for private companies, 70% of it is a direct consequence of mutual disengagement between companies and employees.
Yet companies are a fertile field for the sharing economy, because its an environment where we meet on a daily basis, and a community of trust.
And in return, sharing is a formidable lever for social link, belonging and engagement, individual well-being and collective effectiveness.
Indeed there is a very strong correlation, about 80%, between feeling happy at work and the quality of our relations with our co-workers.
After working for 10 years as an associate director for a consulting group in the field of employment, work conditions and labour relations, Gaëlle Bassuel came to the conclusion that new tools were needed to work in a preventive manner on the question of happiness at work and engagement.
On the basis of the above findings, she created YesWeShare, the web app that allows colleagues to find a fast, easy and secure answer to their daily needs within their company community.
On the platform, we foster all situations where employees exchange, share and interact with each other, whether in peripheral aspects of work life or in social life.
With YesWeShare, coworkers share information, for instance about new comers to improve onboarding, or traveling from one site to another.
They share skills and competences, to encourage peer-to-peer learning and mutual help.
They share affinities and sport, cultural or social activities, such as running or singing together.
They share goods and services : their favorite books, a house in the countryside for the holidays, baby-sitting.
They share their hidden talents.
Soon they will be able to set up linguistic conversations with a colleague abroad. They will be able to send their children for language holidays, which will make it accessible even to employees with a modest income, whereas today its something outrageously expensive commercially.
At YesWeShare we believe that cooperative interactions in the peripheral aspects of worklife promote collaborative postures in the work itself.
All these social interactions foster a sense of belonging, a sense of commitment and engagement within the company community.
They contribute to a better well-being for the individuals, who feel considered as a person and not reduced to a function. And they have repercussions on collective effectiveness.
Lets take a concrete example. If I tell you about Paul the accountant or Linda the head of project, you dont feel any particular reason to go and interact with him or her unless you have to because its strictly part of your job. But if I tell you about Paul the accountant, who plays the basse in a reggae band, or draws incredible paintings, or that Linda is playing in a theatreplay next week, then you might get more encouraged to interact with Paul or Linda. And then both of you as a consequence get exposed to a new project, a new line of business, a new team, . And every one gets the bigger picture, put their own work into perspective, understand the others and their constraints better.
YesWeShare is the 360° sharing platform contributing to social link and individual well-being at work, fostering belonging and engagement between employees.
Today we have clients ranging from 80 employees to a large group such as Etam. We have been selected by Sodexo for VivaTech and are advancing on a number of projects with them.

We think that consumers should be able to choose an oven that guarantees that no suffering has been committed to the chickens.

Why do chickens eat chickens?
Whatever the mode of elevation (even organic), the global agri-food industry allows live pond chickens to a maximum of 18 months; after that, they become less productive and they are committed to reform (abattoir).
Why is this oven not a chicken?
We are committed to not working with the bio-lifts having signed an agreement that does not send the chickens to the reform, but to the Poulehouse refuge and that it is possible to buy female chicks through sex in OVO.
What is sex in OVO?
In order to avoid the massive massacre of male poppies, researchers are launching a new technique to determine the sex of all embryos while they are still in the eye. This way of proceeding allows avoiding a lot of suffering.
What is La Maison des Poules?
The Chicken House is a refuge that we will open at the beginning of 2018 in order to receive the chickens from our partner pupils, for more than 18 months, in order to avoid the abattoir and allow them to live until their natural death.
We work with ethologists to determine what is the best living environment for chickens over the entire duration of their lives. We agree that groups should be made up of a reasonable number of individuals allowing for social exchanges.
How much do the chickens and chickens cost?
The box of 6 œufs Poulehouse is sold at an average of 5.99 €, which is almost 1 € per oven.
The set of costs of our mode of operation is reflected in the price of the egg in full transparency to allow the consumer to understand our action.",,Paris,"agri-food industry, oven, chicken",Between €2.5 million-5 million,2017,https://www.poulehouse.fr/,,FR,

KITnDO,https://www.eu-startups.com/directory/kitndo/,France,"A social-driven platform on mission to empower people with foreign roots by giving them access to authentic cultural experiences & products, anytime they need a taste of home or want to discover the culture of their ancestors","What is the problem?
Whether you or your family arrived 100 days or 100 years ago to a new country, maintaining connection with your roots is meaningful. Maybe you want to prepare recipes from your home country and therefore you are looking for some unique ingredients. Or you want to maintain your mother tongue fluency for your kids and you are looking for a language teacher, bookstore or cultural center. As a person, locally born to a family that moved from abroad, maybe you are already keeping some foreign traditions but you're interested in discovering more about your roots.
Many businesses (restaurants, stores, etc.), cultural associations and service providers have culturally oriented offerings but there is no defined place for them to reach their audience efficiently.
KITnDO is proposing to all these stakeholders to save their time and money, by connecting them on a dedicated platform.
What is the market size?
According the UN, 232 million people reside outside their country of origin, which is equivalent to the third largest economy in the World. Every 4 seconds a new expat is moving abroad.
People are increasingly looking to discover their heritage: the global DNA testing market is anticipated to reach 10 billion USD by 2022 and cultural heritage tourism was listed as one of the fastest growing specialty markets in this industry.
With an increase of international travel, immigration and globalized trade worldwide, the interest and attention of ethnic/cultural products and services has risen. The Global Ethnic Foods Market was valued at 36,5 billion USD in 2018, and it is projected to register an annual growth of 11.80% (2019-2024).
What is KITnDO about?
KITnDO is a web app, accessible directly in your browser. To start, pick a country of origin and indicate your geolocation to display curated content corresponding to this criteria. Our first feature ""Places"" offers an interactive map featuring restaurants, shops, cultural institutions, schools, service providers, and more, sourced for the specific culture.
Unlike Facebook groups, where the information is unorganized, clustered by one country of origin and shared in native languages, KITnDO pulls everything into an easily digestible directory. Plus, you can simply change the country of origin anytime you want.
What about our business model?
As a free tool, KITnDO will be able to sustain thanks to different streams of revenue that we will implement down in order as platform grows and develops. We have already launched an online store with products sourced from different countries, chosen to be authentic for specific cultures. They may be produced from traditional materials or follow traditional methods ; highlighting folk motives or other typical symbols of the country, like landmarks or personalities.
In order to reach a stage where the platform will be self-sufficient, we are looking for an angel investor or seed VC investment.",Aix-en-Provence,"cultural diversity, communities, market place, international living",Between €1-€100K,2017,https://kitndo.com,,FR,

DreamQuark stands out from the competition by providing ease of use, outstanding prediction performance and unique decisions interpretability within a single platform.","Nicolas Meric (CEO and Founder) came up with the idea of DreamQuark during his PhD in particle physics at Paris-Dideront University. His research work led him to explore and experiment new innovative approaches based on Deep Learning which gave him outstanding results and helped him to solve the problems he was struggling with. Nicolas realised these technologies could revolutionise the way enterprises deal with their ever-growing datasets if he could transpose them from the academic field and make them accessible to business experts without any Data Science knowledge or training.
Nicolas founds DreamQuark in 2014 on the basis of this idea and with the unique vision of democratizing IA and bringing Deep Learning to financial institutions. To achieve this, Nicolas surrounded himself with the best data scientists and computer engineers to develop class leading algorithms embedded in Brain, the most advanced predictive platform accessible to everyone.
Today DreamQuark offers to banks and insurance companies a unique IA solution based on Deep Learning that enables the creation of smart applications within few clicks. Brain covers all their main activities such as segmentation, targeting, underwriting, credit scoring, asset management, compliance, anti-money laundering, fraud, dunning, satisfaction and customer retention.
DreamQuark stands out from the competition by providing ease of use, outstanding prediction performance and unique decisions interpretability within a single platform.
- EASE OF USE
Deploying a Deep Learning solution is highly complex and usually requires a data scientist team not necessarily in phase with operational team expectations. To solve this, DreamQuark automates all data pre-processing tasks including data formatting, identification of variables transformation and models training. Without any Data Science skills and within few clicks, business experts can now create powerful AI business application which can be easily integrated in any existing IT system through APIs.
- PERFORMANCE
Brain leverages breakthrough proprietary Deep Learning which benefits from years of in-house research and development. In addition of being outperforming and providing fast prediction, DreamQuark algorithms can identify hidden relations within the data which remain invisible to other solutions. On top of that, Brain can handle structured data as well as unstructured data from images and audio.
- EXPLAINABILITY
DreamQuark’s Brain solution avoids the “black box” effect by providing users with transparent explanations for every single decision the platform makes: users can easily understand what was important to create the model and identify any bias. Brain tracks any changes in models and data and empowers business experts to comply with existing and future regulations (such as GPDR).
In 2017, DreamQuark has won the Fintech of the Year price by Finance Innovation as well as the Best Cognitive Platform award by Bank & Innovation. The multi-award winning company has been given 5 out of 5 stars by the rating agency Early Metric and counts among its clients major banks and insurance companies such as BNP Paribas and AG2R la Mondiale.

RMail specializes in elegantly easy to use email encryption for privacy and compliance, e-signatures, legal e-delivery proof, secure file sharing, email impostor protection, document rights management, and AI-infused services to prevent data leaks and human e-security errors.
RMail installs into one’s existing Microsoft 365 Outlook, Gmail, Salesforce.com, or other email and business management systems.
Install an RMail App:
•	Sender Selects: sender clicks the RMail “Send Registered” button and selects send features.
•	RMail Recommends™: AI-infused prediction technology that, based on message criteria, automatically sensitizes senders, training them in-the-moment of sending, as to what RMail features should be applied to that message, and then sends with the recommended email protections.
Enable the RMail Gateway:
•	Secure Email Gateway: RMail Gateway is a suite of inbound email protections along with specialized outbound data leak and information protection services. Based on message metadata and administrator rules, RMail Gateway determines which messages should be sent with which added RMail features (i.e., encryption, type of encryption, certified e-delivery, for recipient e-signature, and more) and automatically sends the message in that manner, returning a certified record of e-delivery and privacy compliance for each sent message. 
RMail is best for…
RMail’s transmission e-security services are most often used by businesspeople or business systems that send important, sensitive, or consumer-regulated information. These RMail services are generally applied to those messages where the sender needs functionality beyond standard email in terms of (a) easier to use and more automated email encryption for privacy compliance, (b) assurance and peace of mind related to delivery and open status of important and time-deadline email, (c) returning a verifiable proof record of who said what to whom by email, (d) need a timestamped proof of content delivered, (f) need to share large files securely, or (g) need to easily obtain a recipient e-signature on a sent document.
RMail’s application e-security services are most often relied upon in organizations that deal with sensitive client information. These RMail services add unique (a) email impostor protection alerts, (b) auto-train users in-the-moment of sending on which messages should be treated in a more sensitive manner, (c) and create ways to ensure the right email gets to the right recipient, in particular if it is auto-detected to contain sensitive information.",Paris,"Email Encryption, Secure Email, Encrypted Email",Between €100K-€500K,2004,https://rmail.com/,,FR,
