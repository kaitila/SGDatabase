When you are working hard on your business but don’t see the growth you envision, it can be difficult to keep the motivation. Investing your resources; time, energy, and money without seeing your goals on the horizon can really be a setback, but it does not need to be like that. Understanding that this is happening can put you in the right path and give you the connections with the necessary expertise to help you achieve your goals.

Business owners work with accountants and lawyers but are frequently tackling growth problems themselves. A fresh perspective from an experienced strategist will bring a world of change and that's exactly where we help businesses. Strategy is the ‘thinking’ that happens before the action. The navigator to make sure that actions are directed at the desired results. It simply ensures that all the ‘doing’ efforts are directed in the right direction. 

Growth happens in a team. We understand that and are on a mission to help owners and directors to make it easier, less stressful, and more fun. Giving an answer on the root problems that hinder growth.

- Not knowing what steps to take
- Lack of a concrete action plan with clear deadlines
- No longer seeing the trees through the forest when implementing digital components
- A shortage of fresh and innovative ideas
- Struggling with limited capacity and dependence
- Finding it confusing to implement strategies effectively

CEO of Create your Matrix

Our strategists with a background in operations, finance, sales, marketing and digital product building, collaborate to accelerate the growth of your business.

Relieve Furniture,https://www.eu-startups.com/directory/relieve-furniture/,Belgium,"Relieve Furniture responds to the observation of a broad lack of Circularity concerning Office Furniture. The EU produces 10.5 Million Tons of furniture waste per year of which 90% of is incinerated or buried, the rest being mainly recycled. The recycling and reuse of office furniture represents only 4%. In the midst of the climate crisis, it seemed obvious for Relieve Furniture to provide an effective and sustainable solution in Belgium first and other European countries within the next 3 years.","Why Relieve Group and office furniture?
10.7 million tons of office furniture (42 million items) are sent to landfills every year in Europe. For such a ubiquitous industry, the figures are alarming. Of all discarded office furniture, only 2% is successfully repurposed or recycled. From all this waste, next to none of it is reused or recycled properly. This represents a clear and quantifiable place for climate impact. In Belgium, the volume represents 1 million items per year, 90% of which are incinerated.
Yet the vast majority of these items are still in pristine condition even as thousands of potential recipients struggle to find this type of quality office equipment at an affordable price.
Expertise and ambition
With a heritage of expertise that has already enabled the transfer of 25,000 office items to non-profit organizations and schools in collaboration with a hundred large companies (PWC, Nestlé, Lenovo, Ogilvy, etc.), Relieve Group srl wishes to continue its innovative deployment in an accelerated and sustained manner.
Ambition
The Marketplace currently has nearly 5,000 members, mostly made up of schools and non-profit organizations. Since January 1, 2022, the platform has welcomed other players such as companies, start-ups, public institutions, architect’s offices, freelancers, seduced by the circular ""Relieve Community"" and ready to contribute to the deployment of the circular wave to generate a meaningful impact together. 
How is our solution innovative?
Relieve is at the crossroads of two needs. On the one hand, that of large companies that are unable to organize a second life for their furniture in order to meet their pressing CSR objectives. And on the other, that of non-profit organizations, schools and young and/or transitioning companies wishing to fit out their office spaces in order to work in the best conditions, avoiding ""fast furniture"" and therefore with quality, professional products at accessible prices while limiting their carbon footprint at entry.
Relieve offers an accessible and innovative way to meet these furniture needs.
Like other players before it (Opalis, Waio, etc.) Relieve believes in the digitization of exchanges via platforms in order to optimize reuse. However, there is currently no digital platform for the exchange of professional furniture or with sufficient critical mass to be attractive.
The Relieve platform is a Marketplace, so it is intended to be intuitive and adaptable to all scenarios in terms of supply and demand in order to streamline reuse and second-hand traffic.
On both sides, Relieve also responds to the need to reduce the environmental impact linked to the act of purchase by extending the life of quality furniture (which offers the ability to be reused).
 
Differentiation
Relieve offers a series of added values that make it possible to dissociate its offer from those of the competitors:
•	Relieve offers an intuitive digital platform. Offering all the facilities for a complete and fast transaction from the online posting to the recovery of the furniture for the beneficiary
•	Relieve offers donors the possibility of obtaining an estimate of the carbon impact avoided by taking back the volume of furniture they offer on the platform
•	Relieve systematizes the contribution to associations on the amount of the transaction, so it is not an option as is the case elsewhere
•	Relieve targets furniture of a sufficiently high quality and in an acceptable condition to guarantee a second life over time
•	Relieve can also rely on an already large network of donors and beneficiaries. About 140 large companies and 5,000 non-profit organizations and schools are already connected to Relieve via its partner Hu-Bu",Brussels,Second hand office furniture,Between €100K-€500K,2022,www.relievefurniture.com,,BE,

Product development refers to all of the stages involved in bringing a product to market—from inception through conception and engineering design to product development. Computer-aided design (CAD) software is used as a design tool to enhance product development.
As project managers, senior engineers, or engineering directors, you are responsible for finding ideas that lead to new product introduction. Innovation is the essential element that maintains your company’s competitive edge through the development of new technologies, new projects, new angles, and new niches that help you surpass your competitors.
As design engineers or industrial designers, you participate in all of the activities related to product development and implementation. You must first determine if the design intent is feasible and if all of the necessary tools and software to realize the whole project are accessible and available. Then, you design parts (often with complex shapes and geometries) and create 3D models while minimizing iterations in order to shorten the design cycle.
CREAFORM SOLUTION
With Creaform’s portable 3D scanners, three new avenues opened up to engineers and designers. You can develop new innovative products with complex shapes and designs. You can gain new customers by pushing your product development further, where your competitors cannot go. You can be more competitive and accelerate the time to market of your new innovative products.
High-resolution, versatile, simple, and fast 3D scanning tools and software are the solutions to fulfill your goals and overcome your challenges.
 High level of detail: With high-resolution cameras for geometry and color cameras for texture, the scan quality is perfect for developing new innovative products and designing complex geometries.
 Versatility: With advanced laser and optical technologies and limitless scanning volumes, 3D scanners can measure any part, regardless of size, shape, material, surface finish, and complexity.
 Simplicity: With plug-and-play devices and user-friendly interfaces, expertise in 3D scanning is not required. You will get back to your usual workflow (along with all of the necessary 3D dimensions) in a trice.
 Speed: With the instant mesh feature, the generated mesh is already lightened and processed, ready to be seamlessly integrated into your preferred reverse engineering, CAD, or 3D printing software.
Applications
REVERSE ENGINEERING
Reverse engineering is a process that involves measuring a physical object and reconstructing it as a 3D model to recover the design intent—a perfect reconstruction of the original design—in terms of simple analytical surfaces (planes, cylinders, etc.) and freeform surfaces (NURBS) in order to produce a new reference CAD model.
As CAD engineers and industrial designers, you have the critical task of adapting and maintaining parts with shapes that are frequently organic and complex. Since the CAD models are often no longer available or difficult to find, you have to reconstruct the 3D models and integrate them into the design.
The reasons for reverse engineering are multiple: to replace damaged components (for which CAD models are nonexistent), to update obsolete parts, to fit new parts into a current assembly or environment, to generate new manufacturing plans, or simply to analyze competitors’ product features. 3D scanners are generally the preferred technology for extracting dimensional information and representing it as a point cloud or an automatic and instant mesh.
CREAFORM SOLUTION
Creaform’s handheld 3D scanners enable CAD engineers and industrial designers to create 3D models from existing physical objects. In addition, scan-to-CAD software offers you the flexibility to clean, align, and optimize the scanned data, and it allows you to extract dimensional information from the mesh before transferring it to CAD software.
High-resolution, versatile, easy-to-use, and quick 3D scanning tools and software are the solutions to fulfill your goals and overcome your challenges.
 High level of detail: With high resolution for intricate details and full color support, the scan quality is impeccable for modeling freeform surfaces and showing the smallest features.
 Versatility: With advanced laser and optical technologies and limitless scanning volumes, 3D scanners can measure any part, regardless of size, shape, material, surface finish, and complexity.
 Simplicity: With a plug-and-play device and a user-friendly interface, scanning objects without preparation has never been easier, regardless of the user’s experience.
 Speed: Unlike a point cloud, the generated mesh is already lightened and processed, ready to be integrated seamlessly into your preferred reverse engineering, CAD, or 3D printing software.

Qviro is a Belgium-based company with the mission of digitalizing the purchasing process of B2B industrial technology.","Every year manufacturing companies spend 265 billion dollars on automating their production lines with machines, robots, and software. The procurement process of these technologies is very old-fashioned. Engineers spend months comparing different brands because the specifications are hard to compare, it takes time to trust suppliers, and company rules require having at least three quotes. This time waste is a huge burden as there is a shortage of engineers.
On top of that, engineers fear making a wrong purchase, because such mistakes have a high cost and they will be held accountable. Getting recommendations from colleagues is often not possible because internal knowledge flows are inefficient and there are so many technologies out there.
Qviro.com helps industrial users make confident purchasing decisions. On our online platform, we kickstart manufacturing collaborations with a single search, connecting engineers with the world's best suppliers, the latest products, and authentic peer reviews Qviro.com
While we help engineers compare, the suppliers are willing to pay for the trust label we provide in their products because this increases their sales. We do that with a service of collecting reviews from their customers. (Brand Trust yearly subscription)
Analysis of the searching behavior of the engineers using our platform allows us to tell suppliers which engineers are willing to buy right now. This data makes supplier’s sales and marketing campaigns way more effective, especially for reaching small and medium-sized enterprises. (Buyer Intent yearly subscription)

Happy Hours Market,https://www.eu-startups.com/directory/happy-hours-market/,Belgium,"Happy Hours Market provides daily access to shops’ unsold food, just after their closing, at reduced price. 
It is an online platform where we can buy food at a very attractive price, between 7.30pm and 9pm. Afterwards, all the goods that are not sold before 9pm are brought by Happy Hours Market directly to charities.
In this way, we want to fight against food waste by allowing access to affordable and healthy food and by fostering charities food collection.","In Belgium, like in many other countries, too much food goes to waste. Supermarkets have to get rid of food that is about to reach its expiration day. This happens because there is an imbalance between food offer and demand.
Every day, before closing, supermarkets have to withdraw from their shelves food that will be expired the day after since these products cannot be sold once their use-by date has expired. Nevertheless, the majority of these goods are still good to eat on the same day or could also be frozen to be consumed weeks later.
Due to the increased supermarkets concern of about their “Corporate Social Responsibility”, many of them give a maximum of their surplus to non-for-profit organizations. Yet, food not distributed is simply thrown away. At the same time, charities are not able to collect all the remainders usually due to a lack of resources. Consequently, in Belgium, an average of 10.400 tons per day are thrown away.
To fight food waste, we want to strike the right balance between food offer and demand by turning this challenge into an opportunity where people can buy fresh food at a reasonable price.
To this aim, Happy Hours Market proposes another way of reducing food waste by using the benefit of technology to gather food waste and inform the customers. 
In this sense, every evening our truck collects food that will be expired that day or the day after from different supermarkets. Immediately, all products gathered are uploaded to our App  where anyone can purchase them from 7.30pm to 9pm and pick them up the same evening in our collecting points. Afterwards, we deliver unsold items to charities in our neighborhoods free of charge.
Happy Hours Market has an environmental, economic and social impact:
1.	Environmental impact: we limit food waste helping stores to become food zero waste.
2.	Economic impact: we allow shopping at good prices selling fresh products at half-price.
3.	Social impact: we give value to unsold items suppling many charities daily and free of charge.",Brussels,fight food waste,Between €100K-€500K,2019,www.happyhours.be,,BE,

It's in our oceans, and on our beaches, and it's causing harm. We are consuming plastic at staggering rates, since it's durable and cheap to produce. As we know, plastic is strong, flexible and durable making it extremely useful, however, that also means it never really breaks down. A plastic bottle can last for 450 years in the marine environment, slowly fragmenting into smaller and smaller pieces which eventually end up microscopic but never truly go away. This means that every piece of plastic that has ever been produced is still with us, in some form. Current estimates show that at last 8 million pieces of plastic are entering the oceans every single day, with all the implications that entails. So, it's our belief that we need to take better care of our planet. Luckily, a lot of people acknowledge these dangers and many beautiful initiatives have launched in the past years to save our precious planet earth.

Unova is a complete enterprise solution that connects your internal system with blockchain technology to measure and record information about every corner of your supply chain.

Unova provides a holistic data model that enables the frictionless onboarding of real-world supply chain entities, the measurement of their attributes, and the tracking of related logistical events. You can use our connector API’s to create unique digital identities of items you want to track and analyze along the way. This identity and history will be stored permanently and immutably on the blockchain.

Consumers can scan a product and view the full traceability from farm to fork in a trusted way by ensuring the immutability of the data. This allows consumers to make an informed choice and in turn rewards food producers who focus on sustainability and quality of their product. 

Companies have the provenance of their products and can use our main company platform to execute recalls efficiently with minimal food waste. With our system, they can be safe to know they have all the right data to act whenever there is an outbreak. Knowing the full supply chain, based in assets and events (place and time), guarantees food safety, combats food fraud and overall provides a more transparent supply chain.","What is UNOVA?
In short, a blockchain-powered ecosystem & platform in the food industry. We leverage the power of blockchain technology to provide supply chain traceability and transparency. This allows us to create trust between parties that don’t trust each other while at the same time solving many problems that exist within different supply chains. This is made possible by giving the multiple parties & end consumers targeted access to currently unshared or unused data.
Unova provides a holistic data model that enables the frictionless onboarding of real-world supply chain entities, the measurement of their attributes, and the tracking of related logistical events. You can use our connector API’s to create unique digital identities of items you want to track and analyze along the way. This identity and history will be stored permanently and immutably on the blockchain.
Removing current data silos (each company having a separate system and database) which prevents real traceability from being possible. Thereby, reducing fraud and increasing food safety, transparency & traceability. When you look at current policies and compare it with the actual reality of the food producers (especially the meat industry) it is clear that traceability is limited. Excuses are easily made that it’s not technically possible or only DNA samples are used to prove traceability which then turn out not to be accurate. It is time to show what modern tech can do.
We have created a very easy to integrate system and onboarding platform allowing parties to onboard with minimal IT knowledge. A standard format of assets & events which still allows for flexibility and understandable tools to implement. Any producer or party in the chain can create the data which ensures the system to provide full traceability. Our technology is not limited to just food, any product can be traced and problems in other supply chains can be tackled.
Consumers can scan a product and view the full traceability from farm to fork in a trusted way by ensuring the immutability of the data. This allows consumers to make an informed choice and in turn rewards food producers who focus on sustainability and quality of their product.

Knowing the full supply chain, based in assets and events (place and time), guarantees food safety, combats food fraud and overall provides a more transparent supply chain.
We believe consumers should have access to full traceability and transparency of the products. Allowing everyone to know exactly who, where, when and what was involved in producing it. We believe companies should be rewarded for good practices like increasing quality, sustainability, reducing fraud, reducing slavery and basically everything that has a positive impact. To reward them a consumer should be able to vote with their money by buying from suppliers they trust. Meaning the data should be available.
We believe supply chains on an IT level are best managed as if they ere just one company. A far more efficient way to manage supply chains is through the creation of a network, whereby nodes are connected through multiple routes, rather than through the linear “one-up, one-down” model that is the norm in the status quo of supply chain management.",Sint-Martens-Latem,"Blockchain, traceability, supply chains,",Between €500K-€ 1 million,2018,www.unova.io,Active,BE,https://www.linkedin.com/company/unova-io/

However, they are not still perfect because users data has to travel out from their smartphone to providers cloud and this may cause a response delay, requires high-speed internet connections, and last but not least increases the risk of getting hacked, scandalized or abused. All these are because these advanced artificial intelligence systems work based on deep-learning, which is computationally very heavy and normally requires Graphical Processing Unit (GPU) servers.
But, is there any way to run deep-learning locally on smartphones without sending the data to the cloud?
Recently, a Belgium-based startup namely Sensifai launched a smartphone app that runs deep-learning for real-time video recognition on Kirin980 chipsets. This video recognition app understands over 3000 different concepts including objects, scene, human actions, and different environmental attributes with a processing speed of over 30 frames per second on a live video feed from the smartphone camera. The power consumption of the app is less than 150mA, which is only 10% of what Google map uses. This lets users run the app for hours and hours without any battery concerns. Some examples of the app results are shown in this screen recording video.
Sensifai says that the next generation of the app will be running on all smartphones with recent chipsets from Qualcomm and MediTek as well and will be able to recognize up to 10,000 different real-world concepts with a processing speech of over 50 frames per second.
Compared to conventional cloud-based video/image recognition apps, this new technology is truly realtime since it removes the time delays due to a lousy internet connection for uploading/downloading data to/from the cloud or delays caused by cueing the simultaneous queries of millions of users in the central cloud-based processors. Because the new app processes the data locally on the smartphone without any need to the internet and each query is processed right in the users smartphone.
This app also shows that many other apps such as Alexa or Siri can also run offline on users devices and not only deliver more performance but also attract users who fear to share their personal data with service-providers and get exposed to modern cyber threats.
Since the new technology is highly energy efficient, small and light as compared to their GPU-based counterparts, it can be a breakthrough enabling many industries to run real-time image, audio and video processing tasks in the device. For example, the automobile industry can use this technology in their driver assistant or self-driving cars, robots can interact with the surrounding environment and human in a natural way, drones can perform visual pattern recognition, and assistants such as Alexa or Siri can do the speech recognition right on the device instead of transmitting user data to the cloud",Bruxelles,"video, recognition, cloud",,2016,https://sensifai.com,,BE,

Nuvia positions itself in this market as a typical platform provider and is unique in the fact it addresses users/customers by offering them solutions and applications that makes them solve particular challenges in the industry and create true added value for their business. In this respect the Nuvia solution is not one of the many providers of hardware for the VR industry (such as glasses, etc), and/or games and other offerings that are presently on the market, but it brings along concrete solutions.

In concreto, Nuvia is specialized in the capturing of 360° spherical imagery and converting those into full VR enabled virtual tours and it is also looking for solutions to bring 3D to the next generation of digital media. Since the launch of the concept by Google in 2013, Nuvia has developed its own platform that handles the automatic processing, management of data and imagery, manipulation, enrichment and publishing of the virtual tours and enables advertising services towards - amongst others but typically -  merchants, businesses, restaurants, etc.  The Nuvia platform helps them and provides them with their 360° appearance as an attractive way to present themselves online, and to offer additional applications and tools they cannot apply as of today. And this is where the added value for these businesses, merchants, restaurants, etc. is becoming true.
 
Over the years we have become more proficient and have deeply fine-tuned our operational processes and technology, which allows us to scale our business significantly.  Today we can capture 400 locations in 24 hours and have the virtual tours published the next day.  And this is really outperforming the market.
 
Because of the efficiency and output we recently decided to deploy our platform and operational models on full city scale.  In doing so we collaborate with the yellow pages and business listings of the world and provide them our technology, expertise and jointly develop this new and exciting business.  We have captured cities like Kosice in Slovakia, Mol in Belgium, Rio de Janeiro in Brazil, and many more.   In the Benelux, Hungary, South Africa, Mexico and Slovakia we have local teams active and ready to be deployed, in Brazil we collaborate with Telelistas.net, and in Argentina, Chile and Peru we are setting up a collaboration with Publicar.
