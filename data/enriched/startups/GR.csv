These two systems will offer landing and mobility services for large cargo (> 5 tones), parcels (200 g) and modules (several kilos *). The frequency of deliveries for modules and parcels will be at least 1 per 111 minutes per location while a mobile version of the parcel receiver will operate ad-hoc for serving emergencies.
The efficiency increase, wrt classical landers will reach 323%, therefore only 1/3 of the currently needed launchers will be needed to achieve the same result, eliminating by 2/3 the environmental impact of producing and operating these landers.
Large cargos are to be delivered by a wheel-shaped spacecraft (O.P.L.O.N.A.S. **) that lands tangentially on a Lunar plateau called “Ocean of Storms”, and it uses roll friction to dissipate its kinetic energy. Before reaching to a halt, a toroidal tube is inflated to maintain the wheel shape and permit the vehicle to actively roll to the desired destination.
Once it reaches the destination the toroidal tube is deflated to permit the cylindrical payload-containing-hub to reach smoothly the ground level. After we extract the payload, the cylindrical hub can be up-cycled, to form a habitat. The flexible elements (axial and perimetric tethers) will be up-cycled to generate a M.A.C.E.D.O.N.A.S.***.
Landing of OPLONAS generates only minor ejecta, in terms of speed and kinetic energy, due to its low speed (max 1.6 km /sec), in comparison to the rocket expelled gases of the classical landers (4 km/sec) and NOT-omnidirectional. The velocity of the ejecta from OPLONAS is less than the escape velocity from the Moon (2.8) and much less than the ejecta from classical landers (4 km/sec)
Parcels are to be landed by a Lunar-surface-based system, (MACEDONAS) that captures, decelerates, and steers parcels on a safety net.
Unique feature of MACEDONAS is that it does not generate any surface ejecta.
A mobile version of MACEDONAS is designed for delivering emergency supplies to remote distressed teams.
MACEDONAS is also suitable for point-to-point ballistic transportation on the lunar surface. Multiple MACEDONAS can be installed along the track (a frozen orbit) of an orbiting delivery spacecraft.
We are looking for qualification flights to the Lunar orbit or Lunar surface to send quantities of wires needed for constructing an experimental MACEDONAS.

Coffe-eco,https://www.eu-startups.com/directory/coffe-eco/,Greece,"Coffe-Eco is aiming to transform the espresso supply chain from linear to circular. Starting from Greece, which produces 40.000 tons of SCG waste annually, we plan to upcycle 50 tons in 2022 and expand to east Europe and Asia. For every espresso shot you drink every day, you produce 7 grams of biomass waste. Just think that only in US espresso consumption are four 400 M shots per day. Spent Coffee Ground (SCG) is one of the most undervalued biomass. Coffe-Eco uses this biomass to produce sustainable raw materials for the cosmetics and food industries. Cosmetic and food sustainable raw material is a starting point for Coffe- Eco, but we plan to expand to other sectors with furniture raw material, biomethane, and fertilizers.","Solution & Product
Coffe-Eco creates an end-to-end, zero-waste ecosystem for spent coffee grounds. To make an environmental impact, it needs to manage a significant volume of waste and produce various products. We have developed a unique upcycle ecosystem through exclusive partnerships to collect and manage this waste using this mindset. We order coffee ground from big espresso companies through this ecosystem, upcycle it into sustainable ingredients, fertilize (for now), and sell it to potential clients. The sustainable ingredient is produced through a process we develop after four years of research and development.
Fertilize production happens through an exclusive partner.
Our mission is to upcycle 50 tons of waste by 2022 with a growth of 50% every year.
Innovation & Scalability
Our competitive advantage is separated into three layers of innovation.
The first layer and the basis of our advantage is our unique and protected technology of ingredient production.
The second layer of our advantage is the exclusive contract we sign up with our suppliers. This allows us to control the supply and the competition.
Last but not least, through an exclusive partnership, we can upcycle 100% of the waste we are collecting with no limit to the volume.
The only barrier to growth is the long sale cycle of this kind of product. Because of the product formulation process for cosmetic companies, they need time to formulate new products or replace old ingredients.",Patra,"Sustainability, Upcycle, Coffee Waste, Cosmetics",Between €100K-€500K,2022,https://coffe-eco.gr/,,,GR

STOmaker,https://www.eu-startups.com/directory/stomaker/,Greece,"STOmaker is the first global digital platform that offers an end-to-end process solution, marketplace and community for the launch of regulated digital crypto assets over blockchain: Security Token Offerings, the modern digital DeFi form of the archaic IPO (Initial Public Offering). HSBC predicts that by 2025 there will be $15 trillions of tokenization projects of which more than $3 trillions will be STO launches

STOmaker makes the offering preparation efforts facile for non-professional first time issuers and manageable for professional intermediaries. It takes issuers by the hand to bring them through the STO’s interrelated tasks, a solution that extensively streamlines the pre-issuance process for unregulated and regulated digital assets over STOs for equity, debt, bonds, or other existing or future financial capital instruments.","Have you noticed the immense need of private markets to raise funds by new financing vehicles such as STOs over the blockchain? Do you know that the tokenization market is worth over $640 trillions (yes trillions!), and HSBC predicts that by 2025 there will be $15 trillions of tokenization projects of which more than $3 trillions will be STO launches?
STOs are considered as the evolution of archaic IPOs (Initial Public Offerings).
Through our consulting activities we know that there is a problem in the process: Potential issuers looking for liquidity or initial fundraising, if they are larger companies, SMEs or real estate owners or managers are moderately moving onto the blockchains for launching public STOs. They perceive it as labyrinthine complex, because there is a lack of awareness as well as widespread conception of uncertainties in the legal and regulatory positions for securities offerings through tokenization.
Reality is that there are many tasks that are interrelated when floating regulated or unregulated STOs. Here comes STOmaker into the game: we have developed a SaaS solution (still in stealth-mode, pre-revenue) which basically takes issuers by the hand to bring them through the STO’s interrelated tasks, a solution that extensively streamlines the pre-issuance process for unregulated and regulated digital assets over STOs for equity, debt, bonds, or other existing or future financial capital instruments. STOmaker makes the offering preparation efforts facile for non-professional first time issuers and manageable for professional intermediaries.
The solution automates much of the STO issuance process and not only the tokenization or cap-table part. From inception, business planning & risk-analysis, project management, utilization of the optimum regulatory framework, production of required prefab-template documents for all stakeholders, regulatory applications & filings, preparations for tokenization / smart contract deployment, provision of the web presence of the issuer, all the way up to equipping issuers with tools to support the worldwide marketing and selling of the tokens and being listed worldwide on digital exchanges.
In one sentence: STOmaker takes the edge out of the STO tasks interrelation making the STO preparation & issuance process time and cost efficient.
It is an understandably structured, yet embracive SaaS platform that can be used direct by issuers, advisors, dealers & brokers for their funds-raising / tokenization STO undertakings. The platform could handle also ICOs (Initial Coin Offerings) preparations but also IDOs (Initial DEX Offerings, DEX-Distributed Exchange).
The platform also doubles up as a marketplace, allowing and matching - at the right time point and where this is required - issuers to recruit suitable suppliers, from a range of financial, legal, technology, marketing, service partners and advisors. We also envisage using the platform as a hub to build global asset-specific private, professional, institutional investors communities to provide news and investment or partnering opportunities.
STOmaker is currently the only solution globally that digitally systematizes the entire STO preparation & issuance process for tokenized fundraising, covering all steps. It is a combination of RegTech & FinTech and is acting as an enabler, thus empowering future DeFi ecosystems which may run on DLT / blockchain technologies.","Athens, Greece & Windeck, Germany","FinTech, Security Token Offering, DeFi, democratize financing",Between €100K-€500K,2021,www.stomaker.com,,,GR
Intiva Therapeutics,https://www.eu-startups.com/directory/intiva-therapeutics/,Greece,Our goal is to become a leader in the production of premium cannabis oil. Intiva Therapeutics PC (“Intiva”) is a Greek company focused on becoming a leading supplier of >97% THC pure high premium cannabis oil for the pharmaceutical and research sectors in the European market.,"Greece recently granted Intiva one of the earliest licences in the European Union to undertake this business. The licence is published in Gazette No. οικ.123974/1379/Φ64.143, and allows us to produce, export, and distribute final cannabis products. 
Land for production as well as expansion has been secured. Intiva will build its cultivation and processing facilities in Kozani, Western Macedonia, Greece. The facilities will include 55,000m2 of state-of-the-art greenhouses, located on 9.75 hectares of land, for which Intiva has acquired leases for a period of up to 27 years. We have also secured an additional 8 hectares of land for future expansion. Worth noticing is the natural freshwater aquifer that runs under the property, which will reducing water intake cost.
Kozani is well situated to support Intiva’s business model. Geographically Kozani is close to transportation hubs with two airports and one major harbour within driving distance which will support exports to Europe. Also beneficial is the climate and access to a well-educated workforce.  Thessaloniki is the closest city, with a population of 813,000. 
Cashflow positive in year one. The first phase of development is to complete the processing plant, the offices, 48 greenhouses and all supporting facilities capable of supplying 4 harvests each year. Upon completion this will facilitate the production of 12,400 kg of high THC oil per year, totalling sales worth €86.4 million. We expect the company to be cashflow net positive from the end of the second quarter of the second year and from then onwards to cover the costs of future development from internal cash flows and future receipts from the government grant scheme. The expansion beyond the first 48 greenhouses will allow us to more than double our production and sales. 
Our conservative approach means upside to our numbers. The 2 principal drivers for revenue have been assumed to be conservative: (i) Yields per harvest should be higher than 600kg. (ii) Revenue per kg should be higher than €36k.
Once Intiva has completed its equity funding (already underway), it will qualify for an EU government grant in the form of the EU ESPA (ΕΣΠΑ) grant under Regulation EU 1303/2013 as amended. Provided all necessary provisions are successfully completed, Intiva will qualify for a grant equal to 70% of the capital expenditure. The funding required for the first phase, assuming that the EU grant is awarded is equity of €12 million and the government grant of €8.7 million in the first year. As the Company builds additional greenhouses and therefore incurs further capital expenditure, additional grants will be received. The Company has retained an expert consultant who is conducting this process in accordance with standard market practice.
A strong team. Intiva’s leadership team has extensive experience in the cannabis industry, and is inclusive of board-certified medical professionals, agronomists, and executives with strong track records. We will also rely on a roster of local professionals, including pharmacists and a team of specialists from the leading Greek agricultural consultancy IA-Agro who specialise in cannabis cultivation and extraction, but who draw on experience from a diverse set of industries including solar energy, water management, organic cultivation, carbon footprint etc.",Kozani,"Medical, Cannabis, THC, Oil",No funding announced yet,2021,https://intivatherapeutics.com/,,,GR

The field of alternative tourism in Greece is growing rapidly, and this growth creates the issue to connect travelers and outdoor activity providers, with the right tools for both parties. Travelers in Greece are not fully aware of the variety of activities that exists. They do not have the right tools available and need to spend a lot of time searching, compare and book the activity they want safely. At the same time, local activity providers spend time and money to promote their services, while it is difficult and expensive to reach new audiences. Most of their websites are outdated, without adequate information, no real-time availability, and no online booking function. They also have difficulty in managing their bookings.
Our Solution
We have created a user-friendly platform that offers users a complete guide and marketplace for alternative activities in Greece. We protect both parties with up-to-date information, safe payment, and a clear cancelation policy. Travelers can find every alternative activity in Greece in one place, as we can potentially interconnect every business that provides such activities.

Our goal is to bring every visitor in touch with nature and enjoy the serenity these types of accommodation offer.
Our vision is to make this type of vacation accessible in such a way so that visitors from all around the world will be able to appreciate the benefits of this option, making it their primary choice.","Our main goal, with Campsaround, is to offer an All-In-One solution for these accommodations and digitize the booking process.
On the one hand, we want to help owners keep track of bookings online, save time while managing them and get access to an international market through advertising.
On the other hand, we will help guests find online a variety of accommodations, choose the one that they prefer, book it online and pay through a safe bank system.
In addition to that, we create an online presence for these accommodations. Their amenities, facilities, services and all benefits they offer are listed online so that travellers are aware of what they will find upon their arrival. We will also provide them with a PMS to manage their bookings and avoid overbookings.
Our competitive advantage is that we offer a unified solution exclusively for Alternative Accommodations.

Our unique expertise in marketing automation techniques helps us increase conversion rates and returning customers, concerning our B2C clients. Also, due to COVID-19 Campsaround is a platform that can be used by remote workers looking for safe & isolated spaces close to nature.
In Europe, Glamping market size is expected to reach USD 10 billion by 2025. Glamping especially in Western Europe has been growing over the last years at about 7% annually and the preference of tourists in this type of vacation has increased the number of Europeans that stay in Europe for their holidays. Last but not least, the evolution of glamping units, that are set-up easier and offer a great outdoor experience, drive the market to grow.

In December 2020, we won the 1st Award and the Special Audience Award of CapsuleT Accelerator Program, an initiative by the The Hellenic Chamber of Hotels (HCH). During the program we gained important knowledge in the tourism sector.
During Summer 2020 which was the first year of our operations and although, tourism economy has been heavily hit by the COVID-19, we received hundreds of booking requests and managed to serve multiple guests. We brought 25000 unique users into our website, 70% of which was organic and with only 120€ advertisement spending. Last but not least, in October 2020 we won a grant by The People's Trust organisation.
