Riding with someone, who really knows, understands and feels the terrain is always better and more fun! Guidify lets users do just that. Every local rider is an expert guide on terrain he or she knows best. Guidify is a better and more immersive way to discover and experience local trails, spots, lines and places and meet new interesting people.
Guidify lets users:
- Find local riders nearby or filter guides by location and activities.
- Discover, create and share the best spots and places.
- Create, host and join rides and other outdoor events.
- Share experiences and skills like guiding, coaching or renting gear.
- Chat with locals, create groups, share photos, spots and location and much more!
OUR STORY
We are a team of developers, designers and engineers, but primarily, we are a group of passionate riders, adventurers and outdoor enthusiasts.
“Guidify was born out of real life experiences and situations. Often we would ride the local trails and meet people and riders asking to be shown around. These random meetups would then turn into epic riding and sometimes coaching sessions, which would usually end with cold beers and unforgettable memories and friendships. On the other hand, we have often found ourselves on the other side of the equation wondering how great it would be, if someone would show us their best spots and pubs. So in a way you could say, Guidify is made by riders, for riders”.
