We were a winner of the 2020 EIT Digital Venture Program and have closed a seed funding of 300,000 € in May 2021.
We offer customers an at-home blood sample kit allowing for lab-grade results within 24 hours - reinforced with insights by general practitioners. Users collect a blood sample from their finger and ship it to our partner lab. Thereafter, they can access their data in their personal account and keep track of their results. Currently, there are more than 30 available health tests ranging from thyroid panels, STD tests to Covid-19 testing. Our blood collection kit is CE-certified as an in-vitro medical device and cleared for 27 EU markets and FDA-approved for the US. Furthermore, Revolab holds a medical license for Lithuania.
As of now, our product is distributed mainly via our website and app. The current traction is solely in Lithuania, but we are close to launching in neighboring countries by the end of 2021. Furthermore, our service is reimbursed by Gjensidige and Compensa Group insurance partners.
As a next step, we are reinforcing our technology stack by further improving algorithmic features, so the Revolab app will act as a trustworthy medical companion. We aim to strengthen our test interpretation tool with AI, so that end customers don’t only get results but also insights. Second, we aim to create a self-assessment tool based on user input to complement blood results and thereby provide better diagnostics by leveraging ML algorithms.

In reality, there are businesses and households with a variety of underused/underutilized machinery, vehicles, and instruments, which could be rented out on a daily basis.","Executive Summary (TBC)
An opportunity to profit from the growth of the sharing economy
Background
The sharing economy has become part of the real economy in the last 20 years. Ronaker, a new asset
sharing platform is a business which will offer users the opportunity to temporarily hire assets from other
users on the platform (which can either be another individual or a business) at a much greater discount than
buying that asset for themselves.
We are now facing a pandemic with significant economic consequences for everyone on the planet. It’s
time to rethink, go green, and make the best and optimized use of our assets at all levels. In this situation,
Ronaker by making sharing easy, secure, and mutually beneficial, aimed to partially offset the losses
incurred by many individual households and businesses across the world.
The problem – a recognized opportunity
There are many productive assets widely using in industries, agriculture, and other sectors, including
machinery, instruments, and vehicles that are underutilized and can be shared. This wide range of assets
that are costly and subject to depreciation can be shared and optimally being used.
Consider a time-served electrician or mechanic who, over the years, has amassed, at his own expense, a
comprehensive toolkit which allows him to perform his job. He may only work for 200 days a year. There
are 165 days remaining in a year on which he cannot produce a return from these assets.
If another professional or a skilled, amateur needs an expensive tool for a few days, it makes much more
sense to rent it than to buy it. The person or company which owns this tool can claw back some of their
costs of investment by hiring it out.
The solution
In reality, there are businesses and households with a variety of underused/underutilized machinery,
vehicles, and instruments, which could be rented out on a daily basis. They can raise money and make a
return on their assets that is currently costing them money and create no value. That’s a sustainable and
scalable solution with mutual benefits and considerable value-added.
Ronaker will connect hirer with hiree by Android app, iOS app, and by the website. Users can find assets by
category, activity, and tag sorted by geographical proximity to the hiree.",Vilnius,Lending Sharing Ronaker App Renting,,2019,https://ronaker.com,,LT,

The company’s mission is to promote happiness through the gifting of inspiring experiences, whilst reducing the giving of meaningless material presents. Tinggly is the first and only global experience gifting company in the world in which the buyer, the gift recipient and the experience chosen can all be in different countries.","Experiences give us more happiness than things. We also take more pleasure in giving to others
rather than ourselves. And the prospect of an upcoming exciting experience is a strong motivating
force. These are scientifically proven facts that suggest buying an experience for others is one of
the best investments we can make. But it has always been rather complicated to gift experiences.
It is hard enough to choose the right experience for someone else, let alone know the best time and
place for it to take place.
Tinggly simplifies experience gifting by narrowing down the world’s best experiences and making
them easy to gift to anyone around the world. The Tinggly team selected over 2,000 experiences in
over 100 countries and packaged them into 26 gift boxes with different themes and price points.
Each of the gift boxes contains a range of handpicked options, giving the gift recipients the
freedom to decide the what, when and where. Experiences include cultural tours, skydiving, bungee
jumping, gourmet experiences, fastcar and adventure driving, spa and beauty, landmark visits,
extreme sports and many more.
Gift receivers have 5 years to choose an experience from their gift box, giving them plenty of time
to plan ahead. Tinggly is ideal for travel enthusiasts and digital nomads looking to try new things in
different places, but experiences can also be redeemed close to home.
Tinggly was founded in 2014 by Linas Ceikus and Alex Gibb, and is headquartered in Vilnius,
Lithuania. Prior to Tinggly, Linas and Alex have both run successful ventures and have collaborated
together in the experiences industry with other companies that make up the Tinggly Group.
Tinggly is the global brand and the latest company to form part of the Tinggly Group, a group of six
European experience gift companies with over 300 employees and a turnover totalling €18 million.
In 2018 Tinggly achieved a turnover of €500k, doubling its figure from 2017. Tinggly is fully self-
funded.
In early 2019, Tinggly launched Blogger House, a loft in central Vilnius fully equipped to cater for the
needs of bloggers, vloggers and journalists, who can stay at the accommodation free of charge.
True to Tinggly’s values, guests will be shown around the city by a dedicated team member, who

Where's the revolution?
Long story short: we invented and developed a solution that composes music/soundwaves from user data (images/pics/etc), building it tone-by-tone using the Blockchain+AI with natural-like inspiration and improvisation processes.
This means that computer naturally looks at the provided data like a real composers would look at it - getting inspired, with all genius, brilliance and tension - while scoring the soundtrack.
Alongside with music it generates digital art, using data from the composition process as an artistic inspiration.
We propose a new, innovative way for data-inspired psychology-based melodic sequence composition, sound generation, data-driven digital art and visuals generation, new fundamentals for computer-based Decentralized Improvisation™.

daughter play with a toy with two dancers that were spun magnetically.
