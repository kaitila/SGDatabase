Thus, it reduces all that complexity into a manageable, smaller set of management contexts...ideally, ONE!","DATA CONTEXT
Enabler of efficient data management
THE CHALLENGE
Today’s data management is complex. Companies are increasingly data-driven, relying on data insights in decision-making. Many productionize those insights into their own software-as-a-service (SaaS) products. Speed in delivering those insights and products is critical, it directly affects companies’ success, their revenue, cost, and market share. We no longer talk simply about managing data in a database - we talk about managing entire data platforms, which includes other tools that integrate with the database, providing capabilities for data orchestration, ingestion, transformation, governance, stewardship, protection, analytics, science, machine learning, artificial intelligence, and others. Tools and technology market in these areas collectively is around $20 Billion in 2023, with a compound average growth rate (CAGR) of around 20%. This obviously indicates market commitment to data management, where even relatively modest improvements in integration of these tools could mean billions in additional realized revenue.
SINGLE CONTEXT
“Talking” to data had been a struggle until the introduction of standard query language (SQL) some decades ago, as part of database relational technology. Now, SQL is truly standard and widespread - there is hardly a company or software product that does not leverage its capabilities of working with data. Data Context leverages this power and extends the SQL language to work with the entire data platform - this in a way that is simple, intuitive, and adoptable, posed to replicate or surpass the original revolutionary success of SQL.
TECHNOLOGY
Data Context is both a technology and a family of products. Development of products and advancements in technology go hand in hand, without blocking each other, but with mutual leverage across the two. The technology areas include language, grammar and standardization, code generation, proprietary-to-open-source integration, business impact research, data governance automation, and others. Such research may advance the products significantly, all phases of product development, and it can generate several research publications that would not only advance science but also promote the products. The intellectual property (IP) would be properly protected by US and European patents.
MONETIZATION
Data Context may be monetized as a solution via products, as a technology via IP, and as a company via the stock market, with potential exits via acquisitions. From the company's perspective, as the surface area is enormous, an optimal approach is to evolve into a world-class technology company in the data management space, with an initial valuation of over $1 Billion, making it a “unicorn” startup, and a steady growth to become and remain a world leader.

ELNAV,https://www.eu-startups.com/directory/elnav/,Croatia,"Startup ELNAV is developing Helm Order Monitor, electronic device that utilizes speech recognition technology and combined with data received from ship's sensors, monitors whether issued helm orders are clear, confirmed and correctly executed.

To use analogy with road traffic, the Helm Order Monitor would be a combination of Exit Lane breach control with a Driver drowsiness detection.","At open sea, ships mostly sail with autopilot turned on, but to enter the port or pass-through narrow channels the ship must go to manual steering. Maritime pilot embarks the ship and steering is conducted by a helmsman via verbal helm orders.
All orders and instructions regarding the safe operation of the vessel must be done using closed loop communication. Closed loop communication is a technique utilized to avoid misunderstandings. It involves repeat back of orders and positive confirmation that the message has been understood.
Most obvious problem is that Closed Loop Communication does not prevent a Helmsman putting the rudder over the wrong way. Therefore, the monitoring of the execution of the order remains of paramount importance. This is from the Bridge Resource Management manual and how the idea of technological solution was born.
Problem is well described in an interview with a Captain regarding passage through and grounding of Ever Given in Suez Canal: I leave nothing to chance, I follow every pilot’s helm order and helmsman response, and several times it happened that because of a misunderstanding between the pilot and helmsman, I had to jump and grab the helm to avoid ship grounding. 
Helm Order Monitor uses the speech recognition function and, according to the maritime rules and regulations combined with data received from ship's sensors, monitors whether issued helm orders are clear, confirmed and correctly executed.
In addition to solving communication problems, situation awareness and drop of concentration, the device is also an indicator of the last issued helm order.

There are many safety challenges at personal and family level (kids and family safety, injuries, elderly problems, chronic patients issues, violent incidents, all sorts of threats, family violence, bullying, car accidents and so on) as well as at the city and local community level (natural disasters, terrorism..) where more people are affected at the same time.

The idea of the project is to create a heart-driven safety net for local communities around the globe.
The goal of Heroes Nearby project is to, with a little help from technology, turn potentially negative experiences into inspiring stories that help to restore faith in humanity.
To accomplish this we have created a mobile app that connects the people who need help with local community Heroes.
For people in distress or emergency situations, the Heroes Nearby App provides a chance to get help more quickly, keep safe, and be protected by and connected with family members and friends. In addition, our app allows goodhearted, brave people to become real-life Heroes, sharing their skills and helping their fellow citizens and loved ones in distressing situations.

The plan is to embrace the floor sleeping culture (in sleeping bags) and enable more affordable accommodation with a better location. We are guided by the principle of seeing and experiencing more for as little money as possible which rules the young travel community.","Throughout the recent years, the lodging business has been in full swing.
As a result, tourist agencies are becoming less and less desired. Most of the
popular online platforms have situated themselves well, and lately no new
innovation has been presented. This is our chance to offer something new to
the market. FloorNap is a web application which enables the finding of
low-budget accommodation in a quick and easy way. The idea is to provide the
simplest method of accommodation yet, the extreme case being to sleep in a
sleeping bag. Our vision is to create a large community of low-budget travelers
and to promote the Just sleep concept/idea of traveling. To see and travel
more with as few expenses possible.
Many young people have the need to travel somewhere with their friends
and when trying to fulfill that need, the budget is often the limiting factor.
The organization of a trip with friends is often done at the last minute, and
the price to stay at a better location is high. However, if we could encourage
the culture of sleeping on the floor (in sleeping bags), it would free up a lot
of room to stay at some simpler places within such a location. We wouldnt
limit the types of accommodation, but the prices. We want to encourage the
travelers to be mobile in a way that they wouldnt stay in such a location for
too long, but to change multiple places and discover more. On the other
hand, it will enable renters to gain more often returns in smaller sums. We
expect from the accommodations to satisfy the minimum hygiene requirements like a clean floor and a toilet.",Zagreb,"Accomodation, Lodging, Travel",,2018,www.floornap.com,,HR,

The SGS ONE allows small and medium-sized companies the optimal way to establish remote business departments and find and integrate the working staff without the need for employment in their company, significantly cutting out the time and costs of an otherwise lengthy process.  

 

With DaaS, our clients solve four key issues:​

• BUSSINES GROWTH
• REDUCE OPERATIONAL COSTS BY UP TO 50%
• FIND AND KEEP EMPLOYEES
• INCREASE OVERALL EFFICIENCY BY 15%
 
Company Highlights: 

• Backed up by 7 Angel Investors and a Family Office, with over €1,8M in funding.
• SGS is in the position to thrive in the Future of Work (FoW) – International Data Corporation (IDC) 
   forecasts investment in technologies supporting FoW initiatives will exceed $1T worldwide by 2024 with a 
   robust 17% CAGR over the five-year forecast period.
• €50K+ MRR, with a 12% revenue growth MoM and a total ARR of over €1M.
• 9 signed clients and 4 signed channel partners
• The company’s founder and CEO exited two companies (one to Juniper and one to Microsoft) and held 
   executive positions at Cisco, Juniper, Microsoft, Xerox, and ATI.","THE PROBLEM
SME companies have issues finding quality talent to expand, so their focus is shifting more and more towards hiring remote workers.
Remote work is possible but not optimal, as research indicates that human contact and interaction are the deciding factors in creating a healthy work environment and company success. 
Expanding to new regions and markets requires opening a subsidiary, which is costly and time-consuming. 
SME companies, in general, have a hard time accepting new technologies and software solutions which help their day-to-day activities. 
In numbers, SME companies are experiencing the following:
• 61% increase in operational costs since 2019
• 50% increased market shortage of competent and skilled employees in 2022
• 58% increase in employment cost in the last decade
• Lack of competent and skilled labour is the key challenge to 25% of small and medium businesses in 2020
  – the number will be close to 50% in 2022.
THE SOLUTION
We have created a system that automates the implementation of remote business departments.
The SGS ONE allows small and medium-sized companies the optimal way to establish remote business departments and find and integrate the working staff without the need for employment in their company, significantly cutting out the time and costs of an otherwise lengthy process.  
The solution is industry-agnostic, covering 8 core corporate segments each company has. 
WHY DaaS (Department as a Solution)?
• The only solution on the market that addresses the talent problem is creating office space and offering a
   simple-to-use software solution to create and manage remote teams.
• Retaining 100% control over your team.
• Employer of Record - quickly and compliantly commence your operations in Croatia without establishing an
   entity.
• Find the right talent for your organisation for business expansion.
