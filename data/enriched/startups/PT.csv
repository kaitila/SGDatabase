FIDEtechnology,https://www.eu-startups.com/directory/fidetechnology/,Portugal,"Cement production accounts for over 8% of global emissions and cement usage is expected to increase by 45% to 2050. Low-clinker cement and concrete technologies could decarbonise the cement and concrete industries by over 50% over the next decade without excessive cost. Shifting to these low-carbon blends could reduce the cement’s emissions by 1.6 billion tonnes, equivalent to 4% of global emissions — almost 60% of the EU’s CO2 emissions. 
It is currently uneconomic to produce superfine, low-carbon SMC products that can displace clinker production. FIDEtechnology’s patented innovation, the LC Mill concept, enables the economical, low carbon  production of these superfine powders that can lead to the development of so-called “sustainable green cements”.","A big goal today is to improve infrastructure and energy supply to match future societal needs and environmental goals.
However, construction generates 30% of our CO2 and demand could double by 2060 with the planned huge investments in infrastructure, developing continents and sustainable energy. Cement production
alone generates 8% of global CO2.
FIDEtechnology’s long and wide industrial experience identified a common issue: GRINDING
Grinding uses 6% of the globe’s electrical energy. 60% of a cement plant’s electrical energy is used in grinding and 40% in mining for minerals. BUT, the typical grinding machines are only 1% energy efficient.
In 2020 FIDE patented a radical, disruptive Grinding Machine design, promising a 300% increase in efficiency and the ability to reduce CO2 in cement production by over 50%. A.I. will drive the performance.
In 2022 FIDE sold a prototype for industrial environment testing (TRL 5) and in 2023 it was operational at EPFL in Switzerland, producing impressive new sustainable materials for low CO2 cements.

  Initial Phase
A software for building websites
( https://www.softr.io/ ) will be used, connected to an external database, which will be enough to perform the whole service in an easy way, without high costs, allowing to understand even better the market and which functionalities the users consider more user-friendly.
The problem the company solves
Main Goal
Start developing the app in early 2022.
2Gather will have a year to test everything and know exactly what features will be needed in the first version of the App. Besides the app, the website will always be available for people who can't, or don't want to, download new apps to access 2Gather's services.
§ With the growth of digitalization there are numerous platforms, apps and websites aiming to suggest programs and activities. However, besides being difficult to know which one to use and how to start, it is also extremely complicated to go through the process of decision and organization. According to surveys conducted by 2Gather, most people use WhatsApp as a means of communication and to organize activities with friends. The countless messages received in a few minutes on WhatsApp makes matching programs between friends a problem - 2Gather being the solution.
§ 2Gather's main goal is to make it easier for friends to combine programs and eliminate all the obstacles that currently exist when organizing a simple program (from decision making, organizing dates and times to payment).",Lisbon,"SaaS, Mobile App, Tourism",No funding announced yet,2022,www.2GatherPlatform.com,,,PT

We produce web aplications for several specialty contact lens brands available in the market.
Research has shown that ECP’s consider specialty CL management as being time-consuming (88%) and technically difficult (84%), which results in many lens changes (58%) leading to decreasing patient compliance. On top of that, 57% of inquired ECP’s do contact their supplier’s technical support on a regular basis.
Target Market:
- Our customers are the Eye Care Professionals (Ophthalmologists, Optometrists, Opticians) and the market potential is more than 11 million prescribed contact lenses per year
Income Strategy:
- We invest in more productive ways to accelerate app production and new product development.
Revenue streams:
- We charge up to 5,00 € per calculated lens to the eye care professionals.
- We negotiate advertising plans with the major players in the market
- Contact lens app production service (tailor made)
Customer acquisition strategy:
- We use the manufacturers or the distributors sales force when they use our apps as a marketing tool
- We engage additional customers during international events and meetings when exhibiting with our booth
- Social media and related publications advertising
Cost structure:
- Main costs are professional services (91%), Cost of Acquisition (7%) and Rent and Overheads (2%).
Team experience:
- Both founders have an extensive experience in the area! Rafael was the head of the technical support dept. of a contact lens manufacturer in Madrid. He was facing some challenges as his team was spending too much time with tech support leading to a strong decrease in efficiency and profitability. From Luis’ side, as a CL distributor, his customers often complained about the time they waste while fitting specialty contact lenses, which greatly limits his company's sales growth.
Market Impact:
- CLAIRE solutions will increase patient's compliance due to less lens changes.
- There is no need to return often to the physician’s office for additional lens changes.
- It will reduce travel within cities, pollution, absences from work and stress.
Impact metrics:
- Lens changes: - 60% // First fit calculation success rate: 77% // Success on renewals: 100%  // LENS Exchange ratio: 1,258 // (18 months evaluation using our MVP)",Lisbon,"Contact lenses, myopia, optometrist, ophthalmology",Between €100K-€500K,2021,www.clairetool.com,,,PT

Our ultimate goal is to deliver the most possible quality of life to PD patients and we work passionately to achieve it. 
Our team developed a new drug candidate for PD, that targets an enzyme that contribute for the oxidative stress pathologic mechanism in PD. This approach has the potential to halt the progression of Parkinson's Disease. NeuroSoV also works on preclinical validation, both in vitro and in vivo, of molecules with therapeutic potential for Parkinson's disease, thus offering greater predictability of the therapeutic behavior of these molecules, thus anticipating better results in clinical trials.","Given that Parkinson’s disease (PD) is growing exponentially, it is even more important to take attention to the facts that PD may become one of the major health problems of the century and no one is immune to it (Todd Sherer, MJFox Foundation CEO, on Journal of Parkinson’s Disease 8, 2018).
PD is a chronic neurodegenerative disorder that targets medium aged people (average 53 years) with no treatment so far. Currently, there are approximately 10 million PD patients in need of new therapies.
NeuroSoV is dedicated to the development of therapies targeted at slowing down PD pathologic progression.  According to the MJ Fox Foundations 2019 Report the total annual economic burden of PD is approximately $52 billion in USA and ~€12.5 billion in Europe.
PD’s causes are associated with both environmental and genetic factors. Such factors induce Mitochondrial dysfunction, Inflammation, and oxidative stress, among other mechanisms of disease, leading to dopaminergic neuronal death. 
To address this problem our team developed a new drug candidate for PD, that targets an enzyme that contribute for the oxidative stress pathologic mechanism in PD. This approach has the potential to halt the progression of Parkinson's Disease.
Our approach will impact both PD and the drug development fields launching innovative solutions to develop new or to reformulate old symptomatic therapies. Moreover, it will launch a new avenue of research to make available additional new therapies to halt the progression of PD, improving PD patient’s quality of life, and having a high socio-economic impact.  The reformulation technology may also be used by pharmaceutical companies in the development of additional therapies for other neurological disorders. Currently, NeuroSoV has other molecules in its pipeline that we want to keep developing.
Founded in early 2020, NeuroSoV has performed the reformulation and characterization of the molecule and is testing its efficacy in PD models. The company’s goal is to license the molecule to a pharmaceutical company once the pre-clinical validation is completed.",Covilhã,"Parkinson Disease, drug development, molecules",No funding announced yet,2020,www.neurosov.com,,,PT
