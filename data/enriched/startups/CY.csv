Rinnoco Ltd,https://www.eu-startups.com/directory/rinnoco-ltd/,Cyprus,"Rinnoco LTD is a research, innovation, and education consulting company, which enables the development of new unique products from design to deployment targeting international markets.

Founded in 2021, Rinnoco is a startup company based in Limassol, Cyprus, with unique expertise due to its broad experienced team in both academic and industry. The founders of the company have over 30 years of diverse research experience, including SQL and NoSQL databases, big data and data streams, spatiotemporal systems, mobile computing, sensor networks and internet of things (IoT), machine learning applications, quantum mechanics, and significant scientific contributions published in international top-tier conferences and scientific journals.

Rinnoco LTD’s vision is to become the first of the kind company in Cyprus, which develops state-of-the-art data management techniques and provides novel data management tools that can boost the productivity, profitability, and scalability of local and international companies.","Rinnoco focuses on creating data storage tools and platforms that can reduce the storage space utilizing state-of-the-art techniques. The motivation behind this effort is the observation that the volume of stored data doubles every year, but the storage capacity costs decline only at a rate of less than ~1/5 per year. You can find more details on our website (https://rinnoco.com/). Currently, we are at the stage of the basic research and prototyping of our first tool (SIBACO). We got a very small grant from the Research and Innovation Foundation in Cyprus that allowed us to conduct the basic research of our first tool showing encouraging results with ~4%-7% savings (we also got one paper published at SMDB 2023
collocated with ICDE 2023 and one at ADBIS 2023).
We are building two software tools as the first part of our long-term plan. The two tools are:
1. A Signature Based Compression tool, which can achieve higher compression ratios by combining and compressing columns/rows differently based on the characteristics of the data (e.g., type and distribution of data). This is a standalone tool that can be used during the ingestion of the data in any system. It breaks the data into groups of columns/rows and attempts to apply on individual groups the most suitable compression scheme (e.g., GZIP, SNAPPY, LZMA, BZIP, ZSTD) to reduce the storage
space. Our preliminary experimental evaluation of our first prototype using three compression algorithms and two real datasets, we observed reduction in storage space, up to ~4% against the competitors (https://rinnoco.com/projects/sibaco.html).
2. A Data decay tool, which is utilizing Data Postdiction to reduce the storage space. Particularly, data postdiction is using machine learning models (e.g., LSTMs) to capture the essence of the past through its short and long-term dependencies, similarly to how the brain retains both recent information and important old information at a high resolution. The system trains ML models and then removes the data from the storage media, but keeps the models in order to ""predict past values"" (postdict) to recover the original data. The experimental results from my PhD research shows that Data postdiction saves an order of magnitude of storage space, for storing ∼10GB anonymized real telco network trace, while maintaining a high accuracy on the recovered data.
Rinnoco's ultimate goal is to integrate these tools in a modified database such as Apache Cassandra and our business model is mainly to deliver this solution as Platform as a Service (B2B PaaS) with the data management tools being independent software packages on a subscription basis.",Limassol,"big data, data storage, data management",No funding announced yet,2021,https://rinnoco.com/,Active,https://www.linkedin.com/company/rinnocoltd/,CY

                                      Eco Pool Filters
The Eco Pool Filter – an-easy-to-use filter, that vastly reduces energy, water, chemical usage and related costs.
Cyprus registered company HE 455836
Incorporated 26th January 2024
Directors and shareholders – Nick and Jill Gardner
Accountant and Secretary – Nick Gardner - Nick has over 30 years experience in filters, pumps, pools and other water related products. He has run his own businesses for 18 years. Nick is also an accountant and headed a Trust company accounts department for 6 years.  
Save billions of litres of water and electricity annually worldwide.
Water is crucial to life. Energy consumption is a worldwide issue. 
The Problem.
More than 45 billion litres of water are wasted annually across southern Europe’s residential pools alone through backwashing of swimming pool sand and glass media filters (note 1) which remove particle matter greater than 40 micron and require 6 to 8 hours of circulation per day during the summer. (Note 2) 
The Solution. The Eco Pool Filter by EFPF LTD designed and developed by Nick Gardner
How do we save this needless, vast waste of water and energy? A cleverly designed, yet simple filter that also reduces chlorine and other environmentally damaging chemical usage – the EFPF Filter. The Eco Pool Filter significantly reduces energy and water consumption, especially relevant in hot, arid climates where water is scarce. We are looking for an investor to be part of this solution.
Key Advantages:
Reduce electricity usage by more than 25% (Note 2)
Saves more than 90% water (Note 3)
No need to ever vacuum to waste
        – a further saving of water and electricity (Note 4)
Saves time
Easy to use and clean
Unique cartridge filter, patent pending (Note 5)
Lowers chlorine and other harmful chemical usage (Note 6)
Extended pump life (Note 7)
Cost effective (Note 8)
Competitive pricing (Note 10)
 Each filter uses less than 150 litres per annum for cleaning, potentially saving 44 billion litres of water in southern Europe and a bonus saving of 3.8 million KWH of electricity. 
Marketing:
We have engaged Click Marketing (www.clickmarketing.co.uk) to undertake professional branding and build a website with online sales and shipping to reach the global market. To drive additional sales Amazon and retail pool product outlets will be used.
Capturing just 1% of just the southern European market will realise a turnover of Euro 6 million with a potential pretax profit of Euro 4.5 million. We already have a contact looking into the Australian market worth 1.5 million based on 1% of domestic pools. Add to this the ongoing after sale market of the filter cartridges that are unique to EFPF, this is a solid investment opportunity.  
Additional funding:  
To date we have invested Euro 47,530 in this cost saving, ecofriendly project. We own all the moulds, a prototype has been tested over 18 months with excellent results and we are ready to go to production.
To launch the first 1,000 units onto the market an additional Euro 27,000 is required. This will cover all costs involved as per the budget on page 4 below.
We are seeking an investment of Euro 27,000 at 11% in return for 10% shareholding in this lucrative business.
Notes:
1.	An average domestic pool (40,000 litres) sand filter is backwashed 12 or more times per annum. Some pool cleaning companies recommend every week through the summer. Each backwash lasts around 3 minutes resulting in waste of 600 litres of water or a minimum of 7,200 litres per annum. There are more than 6.5 million residential pools in southern Europe equating to more than 45 billion litres of water wasted per annum.
2.	A prototype of EFPF filter was tested over a period of 18 months on a pool that is subject to high volumes of dust and debris. During the summer months the pool was filtered for a maximum of 3 hours per day and no problems developed. This proves that with EFPF filter filtration time can safely be lowered to 4 hours per day, compared with a minimum of 6 hours per day when using a sand filter, a saving of over 25%. 40,000 litre pools need a minimum 1 KW pump, saving 2 KWH per day equates to saving over Euro 220 per annum based on Cyprus current electricity rates. This saves more than the cost of an EFPF filter in the 1st year.
3.	Trials of the EFPF filter on a pool that is subject to well above normal levels of debris, dust and other foreign matter have proved that the filter requires less than 10 litres of water per clean, 12 times per annum, a saving of at least 7,080 litres per annum, well above 90%.
4.	Sand or glass filters do not filter out fine dust, algae or other particles and, if not vacuumed to waste, return to the pool. EFPF alleviates this problem completely. A further water and energy saving.
5.	The EFPF filter uses a unique cartridge filter that incorporates a debris basket, the only cartridge of this type worldwide. The key advantage is its ease of cleaning. We already own the mould for this filter cartridge and it is patent pending. The filter cartridge is antibacterial reducing risk of ear and other infections.
6.	Every time you backwash it is not only the water that is wasted, the chlorine and other chemicals previously added to that water go down the drain too. In addition, normal backwashing of sand or glass filters does not get rid of all the bacteria and foreign matter which results in higher usage of chlorine and other environmentally damaging chemicals.
7.	The EFPF filter is installed in the vacuum line preventing any foreign matter from getting to the pump which can damage the impellor and other pump parts resulting in premature failure of the pump.
8.	Other cartridge filters designed for use with 40,000 litres pools are more than double the retail cost of the EFPF filter and they are all installed after the pump so any foreign matter that is not trapped in the pump basket goes through the pump causing wear to the impellor and other parts. In addition, the pump basket needs to be emptied frequently as well as cleaning the filter.
9.	Free up space. Pool rooms are often small, the sand filter and related parts taking up most of the space. The Eco Pool Filter takes up far less space and the bulky sand filter is no longer needed.
10.	The Eco Pool Filter will retail at Euro 120 for a complete unit. Other brands of cartridge filters such as Hayward and Astral retail for over Euro 250 and do not offer the unique Eco Pool Filter advantages.

Onlyboosters,https://www.eu-startups.com/directory/onlyboosters/,Cyprus,"Video games aren’t easy. To get a rare item or rank up, sometimes you have to spend hours grinding. But not everyone has the time or energy for that.

Giving up on your in-game goals isn’t necessary. Instead, you can use boosting services. Professionals will help level up your account and quickly achieve the progress you need. Intrigued?

Read on to learn everything about boosting. Soon, you’ll find out who Onlyboosters.gg are, their mission, how they work, what they offer, and why you can trust them. Stick around, and let’s go!

Our Mission
Our mission is to help players level up in games, and we’ve got a few specific goals to make that happen.

First, we scout out the best boosting sites for gamers who just don’t have the time to grind. They could do it themselves, but time’s tight. Boosters are the perfect solution for them, and we help them pick reliable platforms.

Second, we support players who find it tough to reach certain goals. Instead of spending endless hours trying to master the game, they can get the results they need right after placing an order on a trusted site we recommend.

Of course, some think leveling up should be done solo and without help. For them, we’ve got another option — coaching from the pros. Top players will teach you how to dominate in any competitive game (like WoW), so you can climb the ranks on your own.

And finally, we know how boring daily quests and other grindy tasks can be. In games like Genshin Impact, there are repetitive dailies you have to complete to level up. We help find sites where boosters will handle these tasks for you daily at a set time, so they won’t get in the way of your playtime.","Onlyboosters.gg — your reliable guide in the world of boosting

Mellow,https://www.eu-startups.com/directory/mellow/,Cyprus,"Mellow is an HR platform offering tools and solutions that transform the way companies engage with contingent workers. It enables the seamless integration of contractors into companies' workflows, streamlining their talent management and selection processes. Additionally, Mellow provides various mechanisms to support freelancers with a wide array of issues, including payment solutions. With offices in New York, Limassol, and London, Mellow's services are available globally.","Mellow is a global HR platform transforming how companies engage with contractors, moving from one-time task hires to incorporating them as integral members of the workforce. The company streamlines this process through a set of technological solutions and by assuming all risks and obligations associated with engaging contractors, such as misclassification or legal issues. At the same time, it benefits contractors by ensuring they are paid and receive benefits, bridging the gap between full-time and project-based work.
Mellow was founded in 2024 by Pavel Shynkarenko, an entrepreneur with over 20 years of experience in financial and legal technologies and client-contractor relationship automation. In 2014, he noticed a growing demand for payment and administrative assistance for businesses working with independent contractors, and this prompted him to launch his first HR tech company, Solar Staff. Initially, the firm provided solutions for service deal optimization. This gradually led to the creation of a multi-tool platform that capitalizes on Solar Staff's decade-long work in this field and responds to the growing demand for specialized solutions for long-term interaction with contractors. Thus, Solar Staff, as a global company, pivoted to Mellow, transferring to it an extensive base of clients in the USA and Europe. Mellow’s mission is to help companies prepare for the future of work, where contract relationships become a common alternative to full-time employment. The company’s CEO is Pavel Shynkarenko, who has stepped down from leading Solar Staff to fully concentrate on this new venture. Benefiting from Solar Staff's client base, Mellow is already working with more than 1,500 companies and 400,000 contractors from over 100 countries. It has a monthly turnover of €18M and an MRR of €800K.
Despite playing in a crowded field, Mellow stands out from its competitors. For instance, firms like Deel, Remote, and Oyster limit themselves to offering either Employer-of-Record (EOR) services for company staff members or tools like payroll management, but do not assume any legal risks. Other services, like Deel Shield, Worksome, and Talent Desk, focus exclusively on expensive Contractor-of-Record (COR) services. On the other hand, Mellow comes with a set of various contractor-related solutions within one contract, and a pay-as-you-go model that makes the non-employee engagement process convenient, transparent, and legally viable. This is the case even when companies are working with contractors from hard-to-reach regions.
The portfolio of Mellow’s solutions is centered on regional demand. The US-based tools, which feature Contractor-of-Record service and an AI-powered tool for finding the right talent by leveraging the hiring manager’s network, are focused on B2B audiences. The European solutions respond to the local demand for enhancing freelancers’ social security, including payment-related assistance, legal services for obtaining digital nomad visas, and tax support.
Mellow is headquartered in Limassol (Cyprus) and has offices in New York and London. The company has a team of 60 people and works with brands such as SumSub, Joom, G2G, Paltalk, Clickadu and Stocksy.",Limassol,"HR, Contractors, Solution",No funding announced yet,2024,https://www.mellow.io/contacts,Active,,CY

A key innovative process we've implemented is extrusion, allowing us to create construction blocks that are ten times stronger and more durable than traditional materials, and houses built from recycled plastic are twice as affordable, due to the speed of construction. These blocks are weatherproof, resistant to decay, and do not support insect infestation, making them an revolutionary eco-friendly alternative in the building sector.
Further pushing the boundaries, we incorporate our recycled plastic into industrial 3D printers (our Ukrainian partners) that are capable of constructing homes, creating an even more efficient building process.

Today, everything indicates that it will only worsen, representing an undoubted menace to the quality of urban life for the residents and an equally severe challenge for the government. One of the core contributing factors to this problem is the increasing difficulty in providing adequate parking for vehicle operators in urban areas. 
Having analyzed the issue, we see that the existing, traditional analog means of parking management, which have been operational for many years, fail to offer a working solution. The current method has not only proven ineffective but is one of the actual contributors to the overall traffic problem. We also feel strongly that the solution must not only address the current issues but also pave the way for proactively identifying and preventing new future problems from arising, such as those outlined in Social Development Goals (SDGs) set forth by the United Nations. With digitalization rapidly progressing across all domains and effectively solving complex problems, we are confident that applying and leveraging innovative technology to solve the Cyprus traffic problem is the way forward.
Our solution is based on a simple yet logical approach to transitioning from analog to digital parking in Cyprus. This will be achieved by installing specially designed sensors operating on the low-costLoRaWaN network in every individual parking space. Each sensor operates in real-time and is connected to one primary database, which then allows:
Parking operators - remotely manage all parking-related services, control/collect payments, monitor performance, and even handle parking violations.

Accounting for the environmental and social impacts of the specified products in construction projects is becoming a necessity in Europe. This is driven by the rising pressure from regulators to reduce emissions, in light of the climate emergency.

Jinn Platform,https://www.eu-startups.com/directory/jinn-platform-2/,Cyprus,“Google Play” for gambling developers.,"What we are doing?
There is a relatively small number of top gambling producers, who have practically formed an oligopoly. Small and medium-size companies face extreme difficulties when they try to enter the market due to the following factors:
-High development costs
-High cost of traffic
-Complex licensing and certifying process
-Lack of the payment systems infrastructure
At the same time, there is a large number of indie developers and game content creators capable of delivering games of very high quality. However, usually they could not properly monetize and make money on these games.
We are solving this problem by creating a platform, which allows to mitigate two key problems:
-Reduce the development costs by implementing a module structure of the backend. A developer gets a “constructor” of a gambling game, which he just needs to “paint” similar to children coloring books.
-Give access to the traffic and monetization of the created gambling content by connecting the platform to private web and CPA networks (affiliates), gambling game aggregators and directly to several big casinos.
Team
The platform development already involves more than 15 people: game designers, illustrators and animators, as well as a software development team.
We also own and operate two casino brands with our own Curacao licenses. The core team has over seven years of experience in gambling and game development. 
Our online casino - beemcasino.com
What we already have?
We started developing the platform in January, 2021. So far we got:
-5 own games + 2 partner games
-Customer area and admin panel
-Collection of various game modules (slots, jackpots, bonus games, provably fair mechanics, etc.)
-Payment gate and integrated payment solutions
-First B2B client of the platform
-In process - certification of the platform and its random number generators
-In process - integration into the gaming aggregators, so that the games can be added to casinos
-Hosting of the game clients
We create our own games and help to build partner projects directly on the platform. Each type of game has specific default game modules, but any combination of them can be used to develop the game.

pw: freethegenie
What we are looking for?
In the second round, we aim to raise 2.000.000$ for 2 years for 15% of the company.
Commercial part of the project (promoting the games in the aggregator) will be launched this fall.
P.S.
Last summer, we tested a prototype of a game (that is, we went through the path of an indie game developer of a gambling game) and we were able to confirm a number of hypotheses regarding the promotion of those mono-games:
There is a big demand for this type of content among the webmasters, who are working with gambing/betting traffic
There is a demand for new slot mechanics (for instance, provably fair games like our Borse Riders) in casinos
There are payment providers willing to work with mono-games
We also proved a hypothesis that the platform attracts developers/designers of the gambling games. We had several negotiations on this matter, almost everyone was interested in some way and one of the interested parties became our first client (Pic-o-Matic studio). They are currently developing two games on our platform.
Even mono-games can pay off, there is a big audience for this type of games.",Limassol,"gambling, games development",No funding announced yet,2021,https://jinnplatform.com,,,CY
