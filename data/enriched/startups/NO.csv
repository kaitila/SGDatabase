Swayle,https://www.eu-startups.com/directory/swayle/,Norway,"Swayle is all about making sales smarter and more personalized. We’ve created a tool that helps sales teams connect with their prospects in a way that feels natural and human, but without all the time-consuming manual work. Our platform uses AI to gather detailed information about each prospect and then helps craft personalized outreach that really resonates. The best part? It all integrates seamlessly with HubSpot, so salespeople can keep using the tools they’re already familiar with.

In a nutshell, Swayle takes the guesswork out of sales outreach, making it easier for teams to engage with the right people at the right time, and ultimately close more deals. We’re focused on helping businesses improve their sales process by combining the power of AI with the personal touch that’s so crucial in building relationships.","Many sales teams struggle with the same issue: they spend too much time on repetitive tasks like gathering information about prospects and personalizing their outreach. This process is not only time-consuming but also inefficient. Salespeople often end up sending generic emails because they just don’t have the bandwidth to personalize every message properly. This means they miss out on opportunities to really connect with potential customers.
This is a big problem because, in today’s world, people expect personalized communication. If a prospect feels like they’re just another name on a list, they’re less likely to respond or engage. This lack of personalization leads to lower response rates, fewer meaningful conversations, and ultimately, fewer deals closed. For sales teams, that means a lot of wasted time and effort with little to show for it.
Solving this problem would mean that sales teams can reach out to prospects in a way that feels relevant and thoughtful. It would make their communication more effective, leading to higher response rates, better relationships with prospects, and more closed deals. In short, it would make their sales process much more efficient and successful.
Swayle solves this problem by using AI to take care of the heavy lifting. Our platform automatically gathers detailed information about each prospect, like their role, company, and recent activities. It then uses this information to help sales teams craft personalized messages that really speak to the prospect’s needs and interests. And because Swayle is fully integrated with HubSpot, all of this happens right within the tools that salespeople are already using, making it easy and seamless. This means sales teams can spend less time on repetitive tasks and more time building relationships and closing deals.",Oslo,"Sales, AI, Sales Automation,",Between €1-€100K,2022,https://swayle.ai,https://linkedin.com/company/77580374,NO,Active

Through greater knowledge of the scheme, help to be approved as an apprenticeship company, and a good matching system in one and the same portal, it should be possible to increase the number from the current 20,000 active apprenticeship companies.

We then make it intuitive for our user/s to connect all the information from the meeting (e.g. tasks, agendas, notes, documents) to other commonly used tools (e.g. Notion, Trello, CRMs, Slack etc.).
How it works:
a.) Shepherd integrates directly with the work calendar making it simple for the users to navigate between meeting events. Right now the calendar serves as the meeting navigation dashboard, however we're in the process of building out an all-in-one dashboard to give the user the option to navigate from a searchable list of meetings too.
b) The user can create a custom agenda template for each meeting type (e.g. Daily Standup) which can be imported into any meeting within 2 clicks.
c) Shepherd then integrates directly into your video conferencing. This allows the user to read off the pre-set agenda, take collaborative and shared meeting notes, and create new tasks, without navigating away fro the video screen.
d) Then once the meeting is completed, the user can integrate Shepherd with an array of other tools such as Slack, Notion, Trello, to name a few. The user can export note, outcomes, summaries and action items to where they need to be. If the user does not use any other tools, they can lean on Shepherd to provide a home for all of their meeting information.
We're also working on building a range of other features/functionalities such as:
- A visual timer for the agenda
- Microlearning nudges to coach users how to effectively run or attend a meeting (e.g. if a 60-minute meeting does not have an agenda 2 days before the meeting, Shepherd will prompt the meeting lead to create an agenda)
- Tag/sort/categorize meetings so that can easily be accessed at any time
- Meeting transcription to make note-taking simple and hands-free
- AI meeting assistant
- Asynchronous video recordings (with timestamps)
- Other 3rd party integrations
- Analytics and insights (which can be fed back to the user)
- Plus many many more
Essentially, we've created a conduit between the calendar/video and other well-known work tools used by teams. We are complementing existing tools, rather than trying to force a change in workflows and behavior.
Our aim is for Shepherd to be a core part of every team's productivity stack. Shepherd can also be used in distributed and in-person meetings, the only difference being the need for video conferencing.",Oslo,"Productivity, Collaboration, SaaS, Future of Work",Between €100K-€500K,2020,www.meetshepherd.com,,NO,

The science behind it is inspired by a heritage of research, called operant conditioning, and further developed in-house, based on real user data and analytics.
The solution consists of a EEG headset, capable of reading brain activity in real-time, and a mobile application for keeping an overview of data analytics and suggestions for action. It allows the user to conduct brain training, which rebalances the brain for better sleep, monitor and track their sleep quality, and receive concrete suggestions for improvements.
The headband itself can be worn during the night for tracking and analysing sleep. However, the Pendulum also allows for third party sleep monitor integration for more accurate data gathering.

 (1) Gain insight into the brain processes which are the root cause of their neuropathology and
(2) To rebalance the dysregulated brain patterns which underlie their symptoms.

THE CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE
The goal of restaurants, bars and other eating and drinking venues is to provide the best customer experience possible. The customer’s well-being is directly linked to the amount of money spent during their stay and the likelihood that they will return.
THE IMPORTANCE OF SOUND
Research has shown that a well composed sound environment has direct impact on how the guest’s overall experience and even how the taste of the food and drinks are perceived.
LARGE INVESTMENTS IN SOUND EQUIPMENT
Most restaurants and bars know how important the sound environment is for a good customer experience and it is common to spend thousands of dollars on sound equipment.
WHAT DECIDES THE VOLUME?
The volume is usually controlled manually by waiters or bartenders in-between their other duties. Lack of information and knowledge of the customers perception often lead to poor volume level decisions.
THE SOLUTION IS WAVED
Wall-mounted sensors are placed around the venue and listens to the sound environment. Waved’s brain is build around our self-developed algorithm.

qbee AS,https://www.eu-startups.com/directory/qbee-as/,Norway,Embedded Linux device management and remote access - SaaS,"Embedded Linux device management and remote access with integrated VPN.  
Industry 4.0, Smart City, Smart Building and many other IoT applications have a common challenge. They involve a lot of different edge devices that all need to be managed throughout their lifecycle. On a typical shop floor or in a smart city deployment there are dozens of different devices that all need to have security settings in place, that need to be updated and configured as well as maintained until decommissioning.  https://qbee.io solves all this by providing a flexible agent that can be installed on any Linux device without the need for additional development work. It is lightweight and pull-based which allows the units to connect from basically any company network or firewall as well as through mobile networks. The build in VPN makes it possible to securely access the remote devices out of the box either through remote ssh access or through full web server access with the qbee-connect desktop tool. Utilizing a VNC client like RealVNC or similar qbee turns quickly into an embedded Teamviewer alternative allowing to simply check what is happening on a remote device. Integrated performance metric monitoring allows to quickly discover any deviations within the device fleet. This can identify log file creeping, flash issues or just high load.  qbee.io provides a full analysis of all software libraries used and checks against the NIST CVE security database. This allows to proactively identify security issues such as heartbleed or similar.  One major functionality of qbee is the configuration management. This part allows OTA software updates of libraries and packages. Together with file distribution and templating this allows to easily configure any application or Linux service. In contrast to Chef, Puppet, SaltStack or Ansible qbee is pull-based. This allows to configure devices based on state rather than to tell the edge units what to do. All devices (also spare devices that might have been offline for years) will receive the latest configuration and converge to that. All this with a minimum footprint and impact on other device functionality. This is very useful to keep ssh keys concurrent for all devices even while rotating them on a regular basis. Typical customers of qbee are system operators that need to maintain a diverse fleet of edge devices, both new and legacy ones. Here a single pane of view helps to get a full overview quickly. Manufacturers of machinery and industrial solutions can use qbee as a remote device management tool without the need for investing into their own development. This allows for fast POCs (proof of concept) as well as for very good ROI (return on investment). Embedded board device manufacturers can offer qbee as a pre-installed solution enabling their customers to achieve a quick time to value. 
 We are happy to get in touch with you and let you know more about our solution. We also offer a 30 day free trial: https://qbee.io/trial/",Trollåsen,"IoT, device management, embedded Linux, operational technology",Between €100K-€500K,2017,https://qbee.io,,NO,

The improvement of the key microphone parameter (SNR) for MEMS microphones has reached a ceiling with today’s transducer technologies. Small improvements in performance can be achieved by e.g. including additional transducers elements in a MEMS package. This approach quickly adds complexity and cost, and can only go so far. A new transducer technology is required to make a significant leap in performance – optical MEMS!

sensiBel’s patented optical MEMS technology that makes the microphone so sensitive is based on a combination of two optical phenomena; interference and diffraction, both of which are due to the wave character of light. In simple terms, the microphone uses a tiny energy-efficient laser to measure extremely accurately the motion of a silicon-based membrane, thanks to the integrated photodetector readout system. This ultra-low self-noise readout principle gives the high SNR characteristic, yet in a small MEMS package with low power consumption.

Additional benefits of the optical MEMS transducer system are enhanced environmental robustness e.g. against dust, and significantly reduced likelihood for stiction (the membrane stuck to the backplate).",,Oslo,"microphone features, microphones, transducer technologies, energy-efficient",Between €1-€100K,2016,http://sensibeltech.com/,,NO,
